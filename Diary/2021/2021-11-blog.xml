               <label>Saturday</label>
               <item>Stayed in bed till 10. It's raining. Breakfast in my warm corner after checking
                  that it's too wet to do anything outside today. Cleaned up kitchen a bit. Did some
                  laundry. Worried bout the chauffe eau. But the coffee machine has fixed itself.
                  Spend most of the morning writing an XSLT stylesheet for catoMinor whoever that
                  is. They want to convert a biblStruct as output by Thing to simple text. formatted
                  according to some project specific rules which are not all actually feasible,
                  because not detectable from the markup. By the time I've got it working, it's
                  lunch time, late lunch time. I am having my steak today and (whisper it not in
                  Gath) some proper chips, as well as the rest of the green leaves. To complete the
                  weekend's decadence, a glass of wine. Watch another Public Eye, and then start
                  this blog, since it's still warm in my typing corner.</item>
               <label>Friday</label>
               <item>Rose at 10. Coffee machine unco-operative, seemingly because when I tried to decoke 
                  it yesterday I left it running with no water for too  long. Curses. Fall back on
                  the bialtti machine. with no water in
                  it.Hacked some more overgrowth off the shed to encourage the vine. Sorted out
                  firewood a bit. Lunch on pasta with sauce of ham, leaves, tomato, rather nice.
                  Bother. Shawn appeared and gave me a barrowful of logs he had nicked from the
                  place he works. Very satisfactory. We arranged to meet for beer later on, and I
                  gave him a jar from my small stock of home made bramble jelly. Around 1745 I set
                  off to walk to Bussiere, through the dark but with my trusty phone torch to show
                  the way. Very peaceful walk with no boggarts or surprises. At Benoit's Shawn and
                  Lisa drinking quietly in corner with someone called ?Don, a musician. Two beers
                  and a chat. Shawn holds me personally responsible for the evils of the internet.
                  Lisa is not going to work for Deidre, no thanks. After a bit realise I am drunk,
                  which is nice. Lisa then drives us home, so to bed by 11. </item>
               <label>Thursday</label>
               <item>lunch of sausage and lentils, delicious. TV aerial conked out in the middle of Asterix movie, curses.
               </item>
               <label>Wednesday 10th</label>
               <item>Walk into Bussiere AGAIN, this time getting some fresh veg from the lady who
                  sets up her stall outside the church on Wednesdays (DO NOT FORGET). Also get pills
                  for itchy legs from Pharmacie, steak from JeanLuc, and a chicken leg from the
                  butchers. Benoit is open for lunch, but it will take 20 minutes to heat up his
                  fish fryer, so I settle for a bavette and frites instead. No other customers to
                  speak of, but it's early. </item>
               <label>Tuesday 9th</label>
               <item>Walk into Bussiere to get some more food from JeanLuc, not that he has much it
                  being Tuesday. Also Benoit is shut. Never mind it's still sunny. My amazon
                  delivery arrives while I am walking back, so when I get hme I can use new saw to
                  make some more firewood very satisfying</item>
               <label>Monday</label>
               <item>Breakfast at the Hotel B &amp; B is minimal, like the hotel, but only costs
                  6.50. Do what I can to get my money's worth, then walk out across the carpack and
                  up into the station, then down again to platform J where my little two carriage
                  TER is waiting for the first journey of the day, to Gueret via Saint Sulplice.
                  Quite a few other passengers. At gueret, I trundle my bag successfully to the
                  Centre 23 Frais, which is of course closed because it's Monday. Grumble a bit and
                  schlep suitcase on into town centre to do a minimalist shopping at Monoprix (milk,
                  butter, ham, bread, a few veg). Then coffee at the Moderne before the trusty TAD
                  arrives. Hello house! Hello sun! Hello grass that needs cutting... Concentrate my
                  efforts on initially on getting a fire going and making a comfortable clean bed to
                  sleep on. </item>
               <label>Sunday</label>
               <item>A leisurely breakfast at the Grand Hotel, tho the scrambled eggs are long past
                  their best by the time I get to them. Sit in the lobby with laptop for an hour or
                  so, overhearing lady booking three successive visits up till April. Apparently the
                  GH sees iself primarily as a conference venue, since their competition is all the
                  snazzy new hotels down the road like the Mercure have stolen the commercial trade.
                  And so to the 1222 departure for Poitiers, stopping at countless improbably named
                  hamlets, like Villeperdue, which it clearly isnt. And at Poitiers, an easy 14
                  minute change for Limoges onto another little TER full of polite students and
                  schoolkids. And here we are in Limoges, trying to get to the B &amp; B hotel,
                  which is not as easy as you might think. It's about 50 metres as the crow fies,
                  but crows can fly better than me. The staircase which once lead down from the
                  station front entrance to the road where te botels are is decidedly hard to find
                  and is also condemned, unsurprisingly, since it is falling apart. The way to get
                  down there is of course not to start from here, but from the side exit from the
                  station, through the bus station, across the car park. Of course. And I am then
                  faced with an extremely unfriendly automat to do the checkin process since no
                  human being on reception duty. (They did turn up later, but were slightly less
                  friendly than the robot). Set off in search of food, since I forgot to bring any
                  lunch and it's now getting on for four pm. In Limoges, on a drizzly Sunday
                  afternoon, lifted slightly by a beautiful and unexpected art nouveau palace half
                  way up one of the many hills which characterize this urban architecture, which
                  seems to be holding some sort of local artist expeosition. As I slog on up the
                  hill, I find several places offering drink or fancy cakes but nothing like food
                  unless I want to wait till six pm, which I do not. I press on and eventually reach
                  the Cafe de Paris, which being a simulation of a real Parisian brasserie, is ready
                  to serve real food almost any time of day. Hoorah. Burger Maison and frites and a
                  glass of rouge for me thanks. After which I feel much better, and stroll all the
                  way back down the hill to the B&amp;B box without further incident. </item>
               <label>Saturday</label>
               <item>Up at 0730 AGAIN, sigh, but this is the last day, and I don't have to do any
                  teaching, just mop up after the others. Lunch as usual. Too tired to go out for
                  dinner with Alexei though I probably shoulda. Bought a scarf from Mistigriff
                  (6.99) cf every other shop I looked in at 30 or 40... Tried to get into the Yellow
                  dog (no room), so fell back on La Maison Berbere which served a really charming
                  couscous and mint tea. </item>
               <label>Friday</label>
               <item>Up at 0730 again, meme jeu, since today is my teach-nearly-all-day day (see
                  timetable). Lunch was in the same depressing place, but the service was express.
                  In the evening we dined en masse upstairs at La Piazza, which was pleasant, though
                  mass dining experiences are always a bit of a strain. </item>
               <label>Thursday</label>
               <item>Up at 0730, out of the hotel, grab a creme et un croissant at the Dakota bar en
                  route to CESR, arriving in plenty of time for my 0900 Introductory talks. Lunch
                  for all has been booked at a large establishment in the picturesque old town
                  square, currently packed with tourists of course. The service is slow and
                  begrudging, even though Sandrine had forewarned them. The food is unremarkable: I
                  wanted fish, which only came in the form of some scraps of salmon on an industrial
                  pizza. As compensation, dinner at the bistrot du marche with elena et al was
                  delicious., after which she gives me a lift home and much cahier gossip.</item>
               <label>Wednesday</label>
               <item>Breakfast reasonable but I am too anxious to enjoy it. Catch packed commuter
                  train at 0945 to St Pancras, and then Off we go, 2 hours ahead of departure time,
                  for the 1230 eurostar to Paris. Much queuing, but it all goes quite smoothly,
                  since everyone is expecting it and we have oodles of time to waste. Journey to
                  Paris just as unremarkable as it should be. I am seated at the very end of the
                  train in carriage number 1, which means I have to walk for MILES when we pull into
                  gare du nord, but no matter. Then by metro 4 to Montparnasse. Plenty of time to
                  pop into c&amp;A to buy some enormous but warming pyjamas, which will be needed
                  soon. Plenty of time for the 1726 tgv to Tours, a journey without incident. Check
                  in to the familiar comforts of the Grand Hotel, where everything is just as it
                  should be. La Chope is closed, so we dine at the Brasserie de l'Univers, which is
                  absolutely packed, but the food is good (magret de canard) Or maybe it's packed
                  because the food is good. </item>
               <label>Tuesday</label>
               <item>Take 14h train from TM to Stratford International via Paddington and Kings
                  Cross; check in to cheesy Premier Inn at Stratford International. Get distracted
                  by interesting exotic upmarket food shops in that end of Westfield shopping
                  centre, where I buy some proper rye bread for Al and Betty, also some diwali
                  sweets ditto. Then stroll to their gaff in goodish time to pick up first Coco from
                  nursery and then Daphne from after school club, which is all very pleasant and
                  domestic. Likewise an evening at the Kayes. Back to my hotel box by 1030. And so
                  to bed.</item>
