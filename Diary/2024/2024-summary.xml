   <p>What's left to say about the year 2024? Almost, but not quite, everything this year seems to
    have been a replay of something that happened last year, with some minor variation in the
    detail... but, no, there were two distinct novelties. We enjoyed some excellent theatre -- <ref target="https://southwarkplayhouse.co.uk/productions/cable-street">the new musical 
     Cable Street</ref> (twice), <ref target="https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/events/sweeney-todd-a-victorian-melodrama/">a splendid melodrama</ref> , and <ref target="https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/events/snow-white-the-seven-dwarfs/">a fine panto</ref> -- and I gave two presentations about<ref target="https://lb42.github.io/Lacy"> my friend Mr Lacy</ref> disguised as a real academic.  </p>

    <p>   <label>January</label>
     On the 19th, P&amp;P took us out for lunch to the charming village pub of Oldbury on Severn, after which we inspected the charming Church of Saint Arilda, commanding splendid views of the Severn Bridge.

    <p>  <label>February</label>
     On the 17th we were in Maryland for Elizabeth's birthday, notable this year for  balloons and a gold bangle.

     <p>This was followed by a trip to exotic Southwark to see Cable Street the Musical (Mk1).  We stayed in a travelodge over the road and ate at a rather disappointing street food market. Back in the West Country, on the 24th, P&amp;P took us to the Clevedon Gardeners Club show, where we ate took much cake and were impressed by vegetables.  </p>
    <p> <label>March</label>
     At the start of the month, we went to Nottingham to enjoy Belinda's new klezmer band in action, which was a musical treat. And then, hoorah for
        <ref target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/2024-03-13.html">An expedition across the Hexagon</ref> during which we went on a mostly Norman holiday, taking in my first ever talk all about Lacy's Acting Edition (in French), a visit to Jef and Nicole, some tourism on the Ile De Re, and getting stuck in La Rochelle, before proceeding to La Vergne for a couple of weeks.    Follow the link for more details and lovely photos. </p>
    <p>  <label>April</label> Leaving La Vergne on the 15th, we experimented with the La-Souterraine-Limoges-Poitiers-Tours-Caen route. It took a while, but the trains all connected. Back in Caen for the MSH's Comite Scientifique on the 17th, and then on the 18th, the overnight ferry back to Portsmouth, which involved much hanging around on Portsmouth Harbour station in the chilly morning.

    <p> <label>May</label> This month I headed back to La Vergne on my own, via Caen, Tours, and Vierzon: see further

    <p>   <label>June</label> We are visited in Bristol by (most of) the Kayes, which provides the  occasion for a rare family photo:

     I have another summer school teaching gig  so proceed back to France on my own again.   The journey to Lyon, via London and Paris, with major train delays at every step, is painstakingly documented in  <ref target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/2024-06-17.html">Best Laid Plans</ref>, as is the continuation from Lyon to Gueret during which I learn (and experience) the French for bus replacement service.  For the last week of the month, Lilette comes out to join me contemplating the grass growing at La Vergne, and we then we fly back together from Limoges to Bristol without incident. </p>
    <p> <label>July</label>
      10 L's birthday at Sonny Stores; 12-14 to Maryland; 19 Dine at Nandos with Robert Price and wife; 23: to Bath for Sweeney Todd; 24 Bahram's dinner party; 26 Lila visits</p>
    <p>  <label>August</label>
     A quick round of visits before we evaporate to France for what's left of the summer. Complex planning needed to cope with sudden unexpected Mauritian arrivals. On the 4th we went to Nottingham, staying at an AirBNB on Loscoe Rd; on the 9th we went Maryland, staying at the Ibis Stratford; on the 11th we were back in Bristol welcoming Roger and Olive. And on the 15th we took the ferry from Portsmouth back to Caen, this time without incident. The news of Michael Sperberg McQAueen's unexpected decease hit Facebook and therefore also La Vergne a few days later, and I spent some time pondering the best sort of response, as did many other people. The fete de st symphorien passed as it always does with excellent music and dancing girls. ;

    <p>  <label>September</label>
      We returned from France on the 6th, with a few days to sort things out for a visit from Mr and Mrs Feigenbaum; we took them out to see the countryside, despite his problems with the car; on the 13th to London again for Cable Street (Mk 2) which was much better than Mk 1, whatever <ref target="https://www.musicalsmagazine.com/features/article/cable-street-review">this reviewer</ref> says; we stayed at Z Hotel Shoreditch in an overpriced un-windowed cellar; on the 18th cheerful plumbers came and restored hot water apparently without needing to send in a little bill. </p>
    <p>  <label>October</label>
     9: Went to Coppa to see L's choir lady sing; 10: P+P4T</p>
    <p>     <label>November</label>
