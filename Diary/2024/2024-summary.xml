   <p>What's left to say about the year 2024? Almost, but not quite, everything this year seems to
    have been a replay of something that happened last year, with some minor variation in the
    detail... but, no, there were two distinct novelties. We enjoyed some excellent theatre -- the new musical 
    Cable Street (twice), a splendid melodrama called The String of Pearls, and a fine panto -- and I gave two presentations about my friend Mr Lacy disguised as a real academic.  </p>

        <ref target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/2024-03-13.html">An expedition across the hexagon</ref> in which we go on a mostly Norman holiday, taking in my first ever talk all about Lacy's Acting Edition (in French), a visit to Jef and Nicole, some tourism on the Ile De Re, and getting stuck in La Rochelle, before proceding to La Vergne for a couple of weeks.     </item>
    <label>April</label><item>15: experimented with the La-Souterraine-Limoges-Poitiers-Tours-Caen route back to Caen for the Comite Scientifique on 17-18. On 18th, took the overnight ferry back to Portsmouth, which involved much hanging around on Portsmouth Harbour station in the chilly morning.

    <item> <ref target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/2024-06-17.html">Best Laid Plans</ref> A journey from Bristol to Lyon, via London and Paris, with major train delays at every step. The return trip from Lyon to Gueret even more so, during which we learn the French for bus replacement service.  </item>

    <item>10 L's birthday at Sonny Stores; 12-14 to Maryland; 19 Dine at Nandos with Robert Price and wife; 23: to Bath for Sweeney Todd; 24 Bahram's dinner party; 26 Lila visits</item>
    <label>August</label>
    <item>A quick round of visits before we evaporate to France for what's left of the summer. Complex planning needed to cope with sudden unexpected Mauritian arrivals. On the 4th we went to Nottingham, staying at an AirBNB on Loscoe Rd; on the 9th we went Maryland, staying at the Ibis Stratford; on the 11th we were back in Bristol welcoming Roger and Olive. And on the 15th we took the ferry from Portsmouth back to Caen, this time without incident. The news of Michael Sperberg McQAueen's unexpected decease hit Facebook and therefore also La Vergne a few days later, and I spent some time pondering the best sort of response, as did many other people. The fete de st symphorien passed as it always does with excellent music and dancing girls. ;

    <label>September</label>
    <item>We returned from France on the 6th, with a few days to sort things out for a visit from Mr and Mrs Feigenbaum; we took them out to see the countryside, despite his problems with the car; on the 13th to London again for Cable Street (Mk 2) which was excellent; we stayed at Z Hotel Shoreditch in an overpriced un-windowed cellar; on the 18th cheerful plumbers came and restored hot water apparently without needing to send in a little bill. </item>
