   <p>What to say about the year 2025? Mostly variations on the same theme as other parts of the
    2020s. The same pattern of occasional expeditions to Mauritius or (mostly) France in the
    intervals of medical appointments and family gatherings; the same occasional  excursion. I
    continued to pootle around with Victorian dramas, giving rise to <ref
     target="https://foxglove.hypotheses.org/category/tei-xml-praxis/victorian-theatre">occasional
     blog postings</ref>, and even the occasional academic conference. Some highlights are listed
    below. </p>
   <p>
    <label>January</label> On the 11th we went back to Oxford, overnighting at the Easy Hotel in
    Summertown before joining the throng celebrating Hazel's 80th birthday. Back in Bristol we were
    taken for an outing to Kings Weston House by Pam and Philip: nice architecture, though the cake
    shop was not as fancy as we had been led to believe. I was rather impressed by T. Chalamet's
    performance as the young Bob Dylan in a movie called <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Complete_Unknown">"A complete unknown",</ref> showing at the
    luxurious Everyman cinema on Whiteladies Rd. I was so much older then. </p>
   <p>
    <label>February</label> On the 8th we escaped to Mauritius for a month or so, staying in two
    different beach hotels, and a third floor flat flat in Curepipe. We experienced a tropical storm called Garance,
    my first such experience: full details are in <ref target="2025-03-27-mru.html">my holiday report</ref> </p>
   <p>
    <label>March</label> Our arrival back in Bristol on the 3rd was fairly horrible, mostly because
    of the journey but also because as we staggered out of the bus station in search of the Uber, L
    realised she had left her phone and kindle on the bus now heading off to Newport. This led to
    much to and fro with the Flixbus website and with assorted insurance companies, but culminated
    in a trip to Newport on the 28th where she was reunited with her gadgets, and I saw some rather
    splendid monuments commemorating the Newport Raising of 1839. We need more chartists. </p>
   <p>
    <label>April</label> For our first French trip of the year, we tried catching a flight from
    Bristol to Bordeaux on 6th, and staying the night there before taking the 1026 TER to Limoges
    (arr 1248), proceeding via another TER to Gueret arriving just in time for the 1430 TAD. But
    what we did for the four weeks in La Vergne before catching the train back to England, I have no
    idea. </p>
   <p> At the start of <label>May</label>, I went to Oxford for a  college reunion: a Gaudy lunch at
    Balliol. This was surprisingly enjoyable: the food was good  and both Carl Schmidt and Nick
    Shrimpton allowed me to drone on about Lacy at them. And people I did not remember at all seemed
    to remember me, which is curiously satisfying. Later in the month, we had a pleasant excursion
    to Bath with P&amp;P to see Opera Luna's version of the Mikado, which I also enjoyed. And at the
    very end of the month, we tried the other route into France, viz train to Portsmouth (the
    caribbean resto opposite the station is actually quite good), and the late afternoon ferry to
    Ouistreham, where we stayed a couple of nights in the Hotel "Le Cosy Riva Bella", enabling us to
    explore the beach a bit.</p>
   <p>
    <label>June</label> From Ouistreham, we proceeded by bus and train to Coutances, and then by bus
    from there to La Haye where Jef and Nicole came to meet us. We stayed in a slightly odd Air BNB
    in La Haye, and did some seaside expeditions with Jef, still in his corset. On the 5th, we left
    them at Valognes and took the train to La Souterraine, via (inevitably) Paris, where we had
    ample time for a (very) late lunch.</p>
   <p>
    <label>July</label>We spent the whole month in La Vergne, doing nothing in particular, and then
    back to Bristol via La Souterraine and Paris.</p>
   <p>
    <label>August</label> We visited Nottingham, and Maryland, the latter on 0 Aug being notable for
    Daphne's birthday bowling party at Stratford. Belinda and co passed through on their way to
    Cornwall, and we vacated the house to put them up, which gave us an excuse to sample Channings
    hotel (pretty good breakfast). At the end of the month, I flew off to Berlin all on my own in
    order to participate in the Dracor Summit at the Free University of Berlin. Very exciting. </p>
   <p>
    <label>September</label> Was in Berlin until the 5th, when I took the slow route back to La
    Vergne, via Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Paris, and La Souterraine, On the 20th, I left for Bristol via
    Paris, again. On the 27th Kev had a surprise 50th birthday party in a pub in Easton. </p>
   <p>
    <label>October </label> On the 14th I nipped off to Caen, by train, for a meeting of the CAESAR
    council, which was fun, though the hotel was noisy. Being in France, I was then unable to resist
    the temptation of another lengthy train journey, from Caen to Tours , Tours to Vierzon, and
    Vierzon to La Souterraine, of course, arriving 2021, where Patrice came (eventually) to collect
    me. Then I had a week or so in La Vergne, all alone, before having to repeat most of the same
    journey in reverse, to get back to Tours in time to teach "TEI Niveau 1" from the 27th to the
    29th. And back to London and Bristol on the 30th. </p>
   <p>
    <label>November</label>From the 6th to the 8th I stayed in a little room in one of the many
    minimalist hotels around Kings Cross. The occasion was a study day on the 7th, where I met and
    tried to impress some of the victorian studies glitterati. Organised by the Caen Punch Project,
    the day was hosted at the BL, even though there was a strike going on. And at the end of the
    month, I yet again popped over to Caen by Eurostar, this time for the MRSH Scientific Committee.
    But I did not proceed from there to La Vergne, and was back in Bristol for the 22nd. </p>
   <p>
    <label>December</label> Which was just as well, since on the 5th, L fell over in mysterious
    circumstances on the way home, fracturing her clavicule, Which meant that almost all  amusements
    planned for December had to be cancelled. On the plus side, I got to know the route to and from
    the BRI rather well; the NHS was wonderful, and we were able to have an Xmas lunch with
    Elizabeth and co, a boxing day amusement with everyone except Belinda and co, and a new years
    eve with Belinda's boys. </p>
