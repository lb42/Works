   <p>Every now and then, someone asks me to explain what we get up to when we disappear to our
    house in France, usually with an overtone of puzzlement, if not downright bewilderment. What's
    the attraction of a somewhat battered house with no central heating in the middle of nowhere,
    hard to get to or from by public transport, and with nothing much to do in the immediate
    vicinity? It seems a good pretext to review what we actually did do there during 2022, as
    typical a year as any. </p>
   <p>My usual excuse for slipping away to La Vergne is that someone has paid me to go to France
    anyway, so I might as well stay on for a while. In 2022, this wheeze worked three times, twice
    because I was invited to help teach TEI Workshops at the CESR in Tours ("Advanced" in May,
    "Beginners" in November), and once in June because I was invited to teach all about ODDs at an
    encoding summer school organized by the ENS de Lyon. There is of course a non-neglible
    opportunity cost attached to such invitations: I have to wrestle with the CNRS or other
    administration to actually get my reimbursement, but I am getting wily in the ways of e.g. a
    horrendous piece of software called "Chorus Pro", and the money always turns up eventually. </p>
   <p>As regards getting there, I think I now know as much as anyone about how to travel by train
    between London, Tours, Paris, and La Vergne. As with Amazon logistics, the tricky part is in the
    "last mile", but this year we persuaded someone else to take on the (paid) role of providing a
    personal taxi service to and from the (not very near) nearest station at La Souterraine. And
    there is always <ref
    target="https://www.agglo-grandgueret.fr/les-navettes-du-grand-gueret-en-transport-la-demande"
    >the TAD</ref>, of course, if suitable planning has been made. </p>
   <p>For example, my first expedition to La Vergne this year involved the following steps: <list
    rend="numbered">
    <item>GWR train Bristol to London Paddington; tube to St Pancras; Eurostar from St Pancras to
     Paris Nord (dep 1331, arr 1647) </item>
    <item>Metro to Paris Montparnasse; Montparnasse to Tours (dep 1756, arr. 1915)</item>
    <item>Check in at Le Grand Hotel, my favourite, conveniently located a few minutes stroll from
     La Chope, where tradition requires that an initial dinner with my teaching colleagues be held. </item>
    <item>Work for a few days, and then get a couple of slow trains from Tours to Limoges (via
     Poitiers, rather than Paris, for a change)</item>
    <item>An evening in Limoges, staying at the cheap Ibis hotel near the station, imposes itself,
     since there is no useful train to Gueret until next morning (there is one, but then I would
     have to spend the evening in Gueret)</item>
    <item>Take the 0910 from Limoges, which potters pleasantly across the departement, stopping here
     and there, and arriving at 1010. Which gives me time to do a little shopping before catching
     the (previously reserved) TAD to La Vergne. </item>
    </list></p>
   <p>For the next eight days, I pottered around in splendid rural isolation. On Saturday I took the
    TAD to Gueret market, where I stocked up on fresh meat and veg, and also bought some tomato
    plants to plant in my potager, once I had released it from its plastic over-winter covers. I
    cleaned the house a bit. I ate well. I used up my stock of firewood in the evenings when
    necessary and watched French telly. I went for a walk round the lake a couple of times and said
    hello to the neighbours. </p>
   <p>I am very fond of tomatoes, especially freshly picked. The climate and the soil in my potager
    seems to suit them very well, which is fortunate since I am a fair-weather gardener at best.</p>

   <p>At the end of my solitary week, I took a weekend jaunt off to Nottingham, partly to see
    Belinda performing with the Mat Davis orchestra, but mainly to collect Lilette and bring her
    back to France. This involved some careful timetabling, but was accomplished entirely by TAD,
    train, and (I regret to say) Ryanair, which provides an occasional flight between Limoges and
    East Midlands Airport. My itinerary was not entirely smooth, but succeeded in its primary
    objectives: I did actually get to the concert before it finished, and I did bring Lilette back
    safe to France. (I even made a series of whatsapp videos recording my progress, yet to be
    edited) The outward leg , on 14 May, went perfectly (TAD to Gueret, train to Limoges, taxi to
    the Limoges Airport, flight to EMA) but although I arrrived at EMA in good time for the fast bus
    into Nottingham, this simply did not materialize, so I had to take the slow one. But I did
    arrive in Hucknell in time to hear the encored version of the Star Wars March. The return leg,
    three days later, also went very smoothly until I got into an argument with a glass door at
    Limoges airport, knocking one of my teeth out of shape. You can see why a chap might prefer to
    stay peacefully in France. </p>
   <p>There ensued four weeks of peace and quiet for both of us. An occasional spot of gardening,
    quite a lot of eating, regular strolls round the lake, occasional sorties to Gueret or Bussiere,
    and so on. This year, the lake has gained a flock of wild ducks, complete with stern notices
    advising us neither to eat nor to feed them, whose melodious singing greets the dusk every day
    (and probably the dawn too, but I am asleep then). With considerable help from Lucy and John, we
    tamed a bit of the back garden by weeding a bit and trimming some hedges. I spent far too much
    time working out how to make the recycled laser printer I bought last year work, and just about
    enough getting ready for my next teaching gig: the first instalment of something called an <ref
    target="https://ethap.sciencesconf.org/">Ecole Thematique Analyser et Publier des corpus encodes
    en XML</ref>, to be held in June in Lyon. I tracked down an emergency dentist in Gueret, who
    took X-rays of my wobbly implant but confirmed my suspicion that this would necessitate another
    trip to Oxford (which it did). </p>
   <p>Making haste very slowly, we packed the house up, and took the TAD to Gueret on the morning of
    17 June. They were setting up (or taking down) the funfair, so place Bonnyaud was littered with
    plastic elephants in cages rather than spring flowers and tomato plants. And eventually we took
    the 1240 slow train to Paris, changing at St Sulpice Lauriere and Vierzon, arriving early
    evening in good time for an excellent Mauritian dinner at Le Dodo, and also for a good nights
    sleep at another forgettable Parisian hotel near Poissoniere. Next morning, after a stroll
    around the Parc Montholon, I guided Lilette back to the Gare du Nord, and waved her off on the
    1613 eurostar back to London before myself heading off in search of a slow train to a place I
    have never visited before called Tournus, chosen more or less at random because it's on the way
    to Lyon, seems to have some nice old buildings, and is probably not too busy. I should mention
    that this is the time of year when Paris (as they say) sizzles, or starts to, so I have no
    desire to stay there for the weekend before teaching begins in Lyon. So I schlep my bag across
    to the Gare de Bercy, clamber aboard the 1533 to Tournus and off we go.</p>
   <p>In Tournus, I enjoy the luxury of the Terminus Hotel Restaurant, which offers fresh fried fish
    allegedly caught by the patron this morning, and a decent enough chablis to wash it down, as
    well as a very comfortable night's sleep. Next morning, I dutifully stroll down the main drag of
    Tournus, which takes me past numerous shops to a large cobblestone square, in
    which lurks the celebrated Abbaye de Saint Philibert, renowned for its mediaeval
    mosaics. Around it there are, as expected, a lot of nice old buildings, and also a lot of restaurants and
    bars and hotels for the benefit of those wishing to inspect same. I make my way through some
    windy mediaeval streets to the banks of the river Saone, a bridge across which we must presume
    gave Tournus its primary raison d'etre, and reflect that it is really getting a touch warm for
    an elderly fat tourist like myself to engage in extensive perambulation before heading back to
    the station and the next train to Lyon. </p>
