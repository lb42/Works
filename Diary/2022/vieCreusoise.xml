  <p>Every now and then, someone asks me to explain what we get up to when we disappear to our house in France, usually with an overtone of puzzlement, if not downright
   bewilderment. What's the attraction of a somewhat battered house with no central heating in the middle of nowhere, hard to get to or from by public transport, and with nothing much to do in the immediate vicinity?
   It seems a good pretext to review what we actually did do there during 2022, as typical a year as any. 
  </p><p>My usual excuse for slipping away to La Vergne is that someone else has paid me to go to France anyway, so I might as well stay on for a while. This year I was invited  again to help in the
  teaching of an advanced TEI Workshop at the CESR in Tours, which paid at least for the Eurostar and some of the rest of my journey, at the non-neglible opportunity cost of having to wrestle with the CNRS 
  admin in the shape of a horrendous piece of software called "Chorus Pro" to get my reimbursement. </p>
