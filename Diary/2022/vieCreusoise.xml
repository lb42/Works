   <p>Every now and then, someone asks me to explain what we get up to when we disappear to our
    house in France, usually with an overtone of puzzlement, if not downright bewilderment. What's
    the attraction of a somewhat battered house with no central heating in the middle of nowhere,
    hard to get to or from by public transport, and with nothing much to do in the immediate
    vicinity? It seems a good pretext to review what we actually did do there during 2022, as
    typical a year as any. </p>
   <p>My usual excuse for slipping away to La Vergne is that someone else has paid me to go to
    France anyway, so I might as well stay on for a while. This year, this wheeze worked three
    times, twice because I was invited to help teach TEI Workshops at the CESR in Tours ("Advanced"
    in May, "Beginners" in November), and once in June because I was invited to teach all about ODDs
    at an encoding summer school organized by the ENS de Lyon. There is of course the non-neglible
    opportunity cost of having to wrestle with the CNRS admin in the shape of a horrendous piece of
    software called "Chorus Pro" to get my reimbursement, but this mostly works. </p>
   <p>As regards the logistics : I think I now know as much as anyone about how to travel by train
    between London, Tours, Paris, and La Vergne. As with Amazon logistics, the tricky part is in the
    "last mile", but this year we persuaded someone else to take on the (paid) role of providing a
    personal taxi service to and from the (not very near) nearest station at La Souterraine. And
    there is always the TAD, of course, if suitable planning has been made. </p>
   <p>For example, my first expedition to La Vergne this year involved the following steps: <list
    rend="numbered">
    <item>GWR train Bristol to London Paddington; Eurostar from St Pancras to Paris Nord (dep 1331) </item>
    <item>Metro to Paris Montparnasse; Montparnasse to Tours (arr. 1915)</item>
    <item>Check in at Le Grand Hotel, my favourite, conveniently located a few minutes stroll from La Chope,
     where tradition requires that an initial dinner with my teaching colleagues be held. </item>
    <item>Work for a few days, and then get a train from Tours to Limoges (via Poitiers, rather than
     Paris, for a change)</item>
    <item>An evening in Limoges, staying at the cheap Ibis hotel near the station, imposes itself,
     since there is no useful train to Gueret until next morning (there is one, but then I would
     have to spend the evening in Gueret)</item>
    <item>Take the 0910 from Limoges, which potters pleasantly across the departement, stopping here
     and there, and arriving at 1010. Which gives me time to do a little shopping before catching
     the (previously reserved) TAD to La Vergne. </item>
    </list></p>
   <p>For the next eight days, I </p>
