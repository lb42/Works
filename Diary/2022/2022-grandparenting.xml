   <p>Though not particularly polyphiloprogenitive, I have three daughters, who have in due course
    presented me with a total of six grandchildren, to say nothing of a scattering of step children
    as well. For the avoidance of doubt, though, indulge me as I take this opportunity to present
    them to you in their spring 2022 shapes.</p>

   <p>My three daughters and their respective families are quite seriously geographically dispersed,
    which means that we have become correspondingly expert in the available public transport routes
    to Nottingham, Maryland (E15), and Stourton (near Shipston on Stour), respectively. Also cheap
    accommodation thereabouts, where there is any (full disclosure: there isn't). </p>
   <p>There are persistent rumours that they all plan to move to Bristol soon, but it hasn't
    happened yet. All of which made at least the first part of 2022 quite busy what with birthday
    parties and sundry occasions on which grand-parenting duties (usually baby sitting) must be
    undertaken. Here's a brief checklist: <list>
    <label>January 21-24</label>
    <item>We went to Maryland to look after Coco, Daphne, and Al so that Elizabeth could join her
     sisters for a much-needed sisterly spa weekend. <ref
     target="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lb42/Works/master/Diary/media/structions.png"> Full
     instructions</ref> were provided and a splendid time was had by all.</item>
    <label>Feb 12th</label>
    <item>Mass excursion to Stourton for a joint celebration of Lila's and Paddy's 12th birthdays:
     there was cake and chocolate. </item>
    <label>March 11-16</label>
    <item>To Maryland again. Daphne made a pizza, learned how to make <foreign>bol
     renvers√©</foreign>, and lost a tooth; Coco just looked cute. </item>
    <!--<label>April 14-15</label>
    <item>Lila etc visit</item>
    <label>23-24 April</label>-->
    <item>To Stourton village hall for Leon's 2nd birthday party: there were lots of nibbles and
     balloons and everyone got quite tired. <figure>
     <head>There was also a seesaw </head>

    <label>July 10th</label>
    <item>Belinda and Sarah came and took us out for Lilette's birthday (aka Panos's birthday
     barbie) </item>
    <label>21-22 Oct</label>
    <item>We were back in Maryland, baby-sitting again the weekend before the big family outing. </item>

    <label>3-6 November</label>
    <item>I am always seem to be away for Belinda's birthday, so this year I suggested she move it
     back a week. We spent a few days in Arnold and Sherwood, doing exciting things like accompany
     her to the opticians and having lunch of course. There were also sparklers, which Harvey
     appreciated.</item>
