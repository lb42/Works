   <p>Every now and then, someone asks me to explain what we get up to when we disappear to our
    house in France, usually with an overtone of puzzlement, if not downright bewilderment. What's
    the attraction of a somewhat battered house with no central heating in the middle of nowhere,
    hard to get to or from by public transport, and with nothing much to do in the immediate
    vicinity? It seems a good pretext to review what we actually did do there during 2022, as
    typical a year as any. </p>

   <p>In August there's no need for explanation. Everyone, but everyone, heads for the countryside
    in August. And the people who live in the country? They head to the seaside, of course. <ref

    >We did that</ref> a few years ago, but this year we were very happy to just stay put in La
    Vergne. The weather was kind to us, and there were important amusements to attend. </p>
