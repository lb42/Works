   <p>Every now and then, someone asks me to explain what we get up to when we disappear to our
    house in France, usually with an overtone of puzzlement, if not downright bewilderment. What's
    the attraction of a somewhat battered house with no central heating in the middle of nowhere,
    hard to get to or from by public transport, and with nothing much to do in the immediate
    vicinity? It seems a good pretext to review what we actually did do there during 2022, as
    typical a year as any. </p>

   <p>In August there's no need for explanation. Everyone, but everyone, heads for the countryside
    in August. And the people who live in the country? They head to the seaside, of course. <ref

    >We did that</ref> a few years ago, but this year we were very happy to just stay put in La
    Vergne. The weather was kind to us, and there were important amusements to attend. </p>
   <p>Since we were starting from Bristol, we took the overland route by train which is reasonably
    speedy, but requires an overnight stay either in London or in Paris, since (as aforesaid) there
    is no useful train from Paris to La Souterraine after 0930. There used to be an early afternoon
    one, but it is no more. Yes, there are flights from Bristol to Paris, and no I do not want to
    take them: you are then faced with the problem of getting from Orly to Austerlitz, which is a
    horrible RER journey even when the metro is not on strike. Instead we have a pleasant evening at
    one of the Korean restaurants on the blvd Saint Jacques, a good nights sleep in another
    forgettable Paris hotel (L'orphee), and get up at a reasonable time of day. Lucy comes to meet
    us at La Souterraine as promised and allows us to make a whistle stop tour of the local Lidl as
    well. And here we are back home in La Vergne, which is still bearing traces of the rapid house
    cleaning I gave it back in May, all ready to resume doing nothing in particular for a few weeks.
    Has anything changed in our absence? Not visibly, unless you count weeds of which we have
    plenty, or tomatoes, which are much improved. The grass is parched, so I don't know where they
    are getting their refreshment from. </p>

   <p>The ducks down at the shady end of the lake are in fine fettle when we go out for an evening
    stroll; the fish are occasionally to be seen leaping, and swooping birds may be observed to
    graze on hovering insects. It's a nice lake, frequented by occasional clumps of serious minded
    fishermen, some with battered vans groaning beneath the weight of their extensive fishing
    equipment, others who just came along for the ride. We grunt greetings to make them acknowledge
    our presence, which usually works. There is a nice view of the wooded hill beneath which the
    houses of La Vergne nestle and two pleasant walks into Bussiere, one following the track of an
    old railway, the other following the crest of a hill. Et in arcadia ego.</p>
   <p>Cousin Dave supplied me with a well-secured plastic tub of sourdough starter the last time I
    saw him, which I transported at the bottom of my baggage (another advantage of travelling by
    train). This enabled me to bake some really quite plausible bread as a change from the baguettes
    delivered by the local itinerant boulangere. </p>
