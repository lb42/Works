    <p>Though not particularly polyphiloprogenitive, I have three daughters, who have in due course
     presented me with a total of six grandchildren, to say nothing of a scattering of step children
     as well. For the avoidance of doubt, though, indulge me as I take this opportunity to present
     them to you in their spring 2022 shapes.</p>

    <p>My three daughters and their respective families are quite seriously geographically dispersed, which means that we have become quite expert in
    the available public transport routes to Nottingham, Maryland (E15), and Shipston on Stour, respectively. Also cheap accomodation thereabouts, where there is any. </p>

       <p>My internet research suggested that a bus trip to Clifden, allegedly capital city of
       Connemara, might be both amusing and cheap, as indeed it was. I stayed in a little guest
       house round the corner from the former railway station, which last has been converted to a
       Victoriana-themed restaurant/bar. Somewhat unexpectedly I ate something here which disagreed
       with me, and spent much of the next day in bed as a result. But I did eventually manage to go
       for a couple of longish walks all the same, one by the high road and one by the low, both
       featuring satisfyingly boggy scenery and views over the coastline. I did not get as far as
       the bit of bog in which Alcock and Brown crashlanded in 1919, having mistaken a patch of moss
       for some grass. Nor indeed the site of Mr Marconi's wireless telegraphy station. There are
       fine monuments to both in the sleepy centre of Clifden, which I duly observed instead. And
       there is also a very nice old fashioned pub called Foyles Hotel where I stayed for my last
       night in the far West, and whose take on the classic full Irish breakfast (shown opposite) I
       can whole heartedly recommend. </p> </cell>

       <p>Salthill has really only one street along which are scattered numerous holiday
       accommodations, pubs, and restaurants. It more or less follows the leisurely curve of Galway
       Bay, along which may be found a couple of beaches, a casino, a fun fair, an antique diving
       platform from which foolish youths can precipitate themselves into Galway Bay, and a stone
       monument commemorating those who tried to escape <ref
       target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)">the Great Hunger</ref> by
       emigrating to the New World. </p>
       <p>The monument is one of many across Ireland recalling one of the more shameful consequences
       of British rule in Ireland. It also serves to recall the plight of other people reduced to
       the desperation of nautical emigration: and to remind us that there is always someone ready
       to profit from that desperation. </p></cell>

    <p>There is also of course a lengthy promenade for walking along, first in one direction, and
     then in the other, to take in the view and enjoy the sunshine, when there is any. Which there
     was for much of the weekend. Sunday was Mothers Day, or as it seems to be called here "Mammy's
     Day" so there were lots of mothers being taken out for an airing and the decent restaurants
     were all full. </p>

       <p>My academic host Justin Tonra, like every other academic I have ever known, has a very
       busy timetable, but fits in time to listen to me drone on about Thomas Hailes Lacy, arranges
       a zoom meeting with the elusive Kate Mattacks, formerly research student with the original
       VPP project, and even buys me a pint at the end of the week. </p></cell>

    <p> For further details of the academic side of this visit, see <ref
     target="https://lb42.github.io/Lacy/2022-07-TNA_Activity_Report.pdf">the official report
     submitted to the funding body</ref>: the rest of this report focusses almost exclusively on the
     trivia of my day to day existence. Being a free floating research student in a far off land is
     a novel experience, after all. I had to find reliable venues for dinner, lunch, and morning
     coffee, find the optimal routes between my accommodation and the campus, and yes why not
     explore the famed West End of Galway as well as neighbouring tourist attractions so long as I'm
     here. </p>
