   <p>What's left to say about the year 2022? I survived it, as did most of those near and dear to
    me. Despite coming close several times, the UK's current apology for a government did not
    entirely collapse. As both the rest of this text and the above graphic attest, I spent much of the year trying to avoid thinking about
    the government by travelling. (Each red spot is a location where Mr
    Google spotted me.) I also spent quite a lot of time engaged on <ref
    target="http://lb42.github.io/Diary/grandparenting.html"> grand-parenting duties, </ref> of
    course. </p>

    <item>In January and February, I seem to have done a lot of running about between dentists and
     doctors. I also paid my Covid dues and stayed in bed for a few days. I even did some work,
     trying my best to contribute something sensible to the <ref
     target="https://foxglove.hypotheses.org/669">CLS WG3 project on counting "verbs of inner
     life".</ref> </item>
    <item>In March <ref target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/wanderings-1.html">I went to Galway for
     three weeks</ref>, nervously clutching a prestigious CLS INFRA fellowship to test my brief (but
     very enjoyable) reincarnation as an itinerant scholar. </item>
    <item>In May I went, as usual, to Tours to teach TEI "niveau 2", and then to La Vergne <ref
     target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/vieFrancaise-1.html">where I stayed until June</ref>, with
     the exception of a brief side trip to Nottingham to enjoy a Belinda concert and collect
     Lilette. </item>
    <item>In June Lilette returned to Bristol and I went to Lyon to teach at an ENS summer school:
     it was very hot and <ref target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/2022-07-blog.html">the journey
     home was somewhat stressful</ref>.</item>
    <item>In July, after a quick dash back to Oxford for dental and other purposes, I fitted in <ref
     target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/wanderings-2.html">another brief visit to Galway</ref> to
     wrap up my fellowship alas. </item>
    <item><ref target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/vieFrancaise-2.html">In August we escaped to La
     Vergne again</ref>: in good time for both the Fete de Saint Syphorien and an unexpected outing. </item>
    <item>In mid-September, I reluctantly came back to the UK, to attend (and address) the <ref
     target="https://conferences.ncl.ac.uk/tei2022/programme/">annual TEI conference</ref>, this
     year hosted by the University of Newcastle. Check out session 6B for an audio (but not alas
     video) recording of the session in which I held forth. Pompous, moi? </item>
    <item>At the end of October, we celebrated (a bit early) our golden wedding anniversary with an
     extraordinary family holiday in the Forest of Dean. As well as many meals, some country walks,
     and much rushing about by Mr and Mrs Shiny, this featured <ref
     target="http://lb42.github.io/Family/">four talks on family history</ref> by me, one for each
     of five decades. <ref target="https://photos.app.goo.gl/sYRpUvzH7YbA49Fz6">Many photos</ref>
     were taken.</item>
    <item>In November I managed to fit in <ref
     target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/vieFrancaise-3.html">another escape to France</ref>,
     comprising a week in La Vergne, three days teaching TEI Level 1 in Tours, a day off to inspect
     a well known cathedral, and a day long meeting in Paris, before joining Lilette for <ref
     target="https://lb42.github.io/Diary/21days.html">a three week break in Mauritius</ref>,
     not before time. </item>
   </list>
   <p>Minute details of where and when are all logged in my Google Location History, but I don't
    know how to share that, other than by the occasional screen shot. But there are links to more
    detailed reportage of various kinds in the above list.</p>
