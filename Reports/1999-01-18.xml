   <p>Presiding genius and visionary of both ECAI and EBTI is Lewis
Lancaster from the Department of East Asian Studies at UC Berkeley, but both
groups have an extraordinary roster of distinguished and energetic
scholars and institutions scattered around the Pacific rim,
co-operating in a number of equally impressive digitization
projects. This was the third of their international conferences at
which I have had the honour of being invited to present a TEI
Workshop; previous events were held at Haiensa Monastery in Korea in
1994, and Otani University in Kyoto in 1996, and the next will be at
Berkeley in California next year. The sheer scale of EBTI's interest,
embracing canons of ancient texts in Pali, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Korean,
Chinese, Japanese, and other less well-known languages, makes for a
pretty rigorous test of the TEI's claimed ability to cope with all
texts in all languages of all times. Put this together with a
characteristically Buddhist atmosphere of mutual tolerance and
altruistic scholarship (to say nothing of the lure of their exotic
locations) and it is understandable why such invitations are hard to
resist.
</p>
   <p>The 1999 event was hosted by <ref target="http://www.sinica.edu.tw/index.shtml">Academia Sinica</ref>, a
Taiwanese government funded research institution and the Taiwanese
Ministry of Education. Academia Sinica has a long history of interest
in SGML and XML; one of its chief luminaries being Professor
Ching-chun Hsieh, architect of (amongst other things) the
modifications to Unicode needed for it to handle the full range of
ancient Chinese characters.  Indeed, should the TEI decide that it
needs a host organization in this part of the world, I think that
Academia Sinica would be a natural first choice for a site to
approach.  Also in Taipei, at the National Taiwan University but in
close contact with Academia Sinica, the CBETA project, is creating a
TEI-conformant corpus of the Chinese Tripitaka.  involving Christian
Wittern, inventor of the 
      <ref target="http://www.gwdg.de/~cwitter/kanjibas/cefintro.htm">Kanjibase</ref>
is a recent recruit to Academia Sinica, and is converting several
large structured-text databases to TEI.  Both Christian and Rick are
enthusiastic promoters of the TEI.
</p>

   <p>The conference proper was preceded by four tutorial workshops on
Metadata and the Dublin Core, by Helen Jarvis (University of New South
Wales); TEI (me); GIS by Lawrence Crissman (Griffith University); and
Image Data by Jan Glowski (Ohio State). I missed all of these except
my own, owing to a pressing need to revise my overheads and drink
as much of the Academia Sinica's excellent coffee as I could afford,
but the handouts indicate that they all provided a useful technical
overview of these four key topics. After the workshops, Rick Jelliffe
kindly shepherded a group of us long-noses around the famous
night-markets of downtown Taipei, where I bargained furiously for
brass ornaments, and eat lots of tasty sausages, and freshly cooked
chestnuts. My appetite for exploration thus whetted, I must confess to
taking a whole day off to wander around Taipei on my own which was an
exhausting but extraordinary experience.
</p>
   <p>The conference itself spread over four days, with up to four
parallel sessions running throughout, each devoted to progress reports
and position papers about text creation projects, networking and
digital library projects, and GIS applications in Asian studies. Most
of the presenters came from Taiwan, Japan, USA, Australia or Korea,
but India, Nepal, Thailand, Russia, Germany, France, Mexico, and the
UK were also represented. We were fed at regular intervals with
excellent Chinese buns and other goodies, quite apart from plentiful
Chinese lunches, and there was much extra-session activity and
discussion, involving the exchange of business cards. There was also a
splendid Chinese banquet, held in the Taipei Business Club (a building
that has to be experienced to be believed), complete with witty
meditations on the approaching millenium from a very distinguished
Taiwanese professor and a welcoming speech from the newly elected
mayor of Taipei, whose election pledges apparently include Internet
access for one in three inhabitants of the city, quite apart from
finishing the rapid transit system that Taipei desperately needs. I'm
not sure what we eat (apart from the Sharks Fin Soup) but it was all
very tasty, and plentiful.
</p>
   <p>An opening plenary by Roy Weber from AT&amp;T gave a taste of some of
AT&amp;T's more futuristic products, based on close integration of
internet and conventional telephony systems: these included WISL,
allowing for management of distributed telephone sales staff (did you
know that nearly half of all calls to AT&amp;T are to 800 numbers?); a
deluxe form of video-conferencing called "virtual presence"; and the
endearingly-titled "cyber fridge", (named after the fridge on which all
good US families post family-oriented information) which we will all
use to keep in touch when our homes have permanently active
internet connexions, and flat display panels are built into
refrigerator doors. 
</p>
   <p>One of the two other Brits at the conference, Susan Whitfield,
reported progress on the <ref target="http://idp.bl.uk">International
Dunhuang Project</ref> at the British Library, home of the "sponsor a
sutra" digitization scheme.  Not content with digitizing this
extraordinary collection of 20,000 manuscripts and manuscript
fragments, all now catalogued, the project is now developing an
integrated catalogue of the Stein photo archive. This links extracts
from Stein's diary of his turn of the century travels along the Silk
Road with the photographs he took; its use of a geographic or spatial
metaphor as a way of accessing disparate collections of digital
resources seemed genuinely innovative to me and was a recurrent theme
of the conference.
</p>
   <p>Tom Duncan, from the <ref target="http://www.mip.berkeley.edu/">Museum
Informatics Project</ref> at Berkeley, described some of the technology
underlying their project, based on the use of Sybase as a data manager
for 50,000 images, delivered via JTIP compression, and also as a means
of providing full text retrieval from the Korean Buddhist text
canon. They deploy a traditional thesaurus style access to these
resources via a Sybase implementation of a range of standard
thesauri. Howie Lan, also from Berkeley, gave an overview of other
Digital Library research activities at Berkeley, but ran out of time
before getting down to much real detail of his advertised topic of <ref target="http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/ib/about.html">"multivalent
documents"</ref> (I think this is mostly about combining digital images,
transcriptions, and other views of a document)
</p>
   <p>I attended a business meeting of ECAI, my curiosity about which had
been sparked by an introduction to the power of GIS systems which <ref target="http://www.archaeology.usyd.edu.au/people/staff_pages/ij.html">Ian
Johnson </ref> kindly gave me during a long conversation about the
relative merits of XML and RDBMS for organizing data. ECAI has an
active technical group apparently largely driven by said Johnson and
other Australians, and an interesting programme of work. The plan
appears to be to collect metadata describing any and all datasets
relating to Asian cultural materials using a modified (surprise!) set
of Dublin Core descriptors, and to provide access to the corresponding
distributed datasets via a new desktop mapping system called <ref target="http://www.archaeology.usyd.edu.au/research/time_map/index.html">Timemap</ref>.
I muttered about <ref target="http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/nost/isoas/overview.html">OAIS</ref>
and the Warwick framework, and perhaps more significantly infiltrated
a late night drinking session hosted by the imperturable Helen Jarvis
(who is, incidentally, co-author of the <ref target="http://www-cgp.silas.unsw.edu.au/paper.htm">definitive study of
Cambodian atrocities </ref>) and a frock-coated <ref target="http://www.ciolek.com">Matthew Ciolek</ref> (of WWW Virtual
library fame).  I hope to persuade some of those involved in <ref target="http://www.ias.berkeley.edu/ecai/tech/ECAITech.html">ECAI's
technical group </ref> to present a session at this year's DRH
conference, since I think we have much to learn from the scale and
scope of ECAI, quite apart from its intrinsic interest.

</p>
   <p>A recurrent theme of the EBTI sessions on ancient Chinese and
Japanese texts concerned the difficulty of encoding such texts in a
standard way resulting from the Unicode Consortium's decision to
"unify" CJK scripts. <ref target="http://www.bekoame.or.jp/i/moro">Shigeki Moro</ref>, for example, reported that in
encoding the Taisho Tripitaka (which includes both ancient Japanese
and Chinese marterial) they had so far needed 5840 distinct
charavcters, of which 1264 were unavailable in JIS and 338 were
missing from Unicode. These so-called Gaiji have to be represented by
SGML-like entity references, using numbers assigned by inventories
such as Wittern's Kanjibase; when their textbase is converted to XML,
they propose to use empty elements for the purpose. In the same
session I learned of the existence of the <ref target="http://www.mojikyo.gr.jp">Mojikyo Font Center
</ref>, an admirable organization which provides free
Truetype fonts for over 80,000 Japanese and Chinese characters.
</p>
   <p>Technical solutions to linguistic diversity was a recurrent theme
in the EBTI sessions I attended. Amongst many others, I noted the
following: Jost Gippert presented the TITUS (Thesaurus
Indogermanischer Text- und Sprachmaterialien) project at the
University of Frankfurt, demonstrating alignment of several texts
from this immense collection using WordCruncher; the <ref target="http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de">TITUS site
</ref> also includes an ingenious set of
pages for testing the ability of your system to deal with Unicode.
Dhanajay Chavan from the Vipassana Research Institute in India
demonstrated the new version of the <ref target="http://www.tipitaka.org/cscd/overview.htm">Chattha Sangayana CD
</ref> which allows the entire
Pali canon to be viewed in Devanagari, Roman, Myanmar, Thai,
Sinhalese, Cambodian or Mongolian scripts. Marvin Moser from Lucent
Technologies in Chicago presented an <ref target="http://www.tibet.dk/tibetan_clipart/mmoser.htm">input system for Tibetan script
</ref> which (I learned) has similar "stacking" problems to classical
Arabic. The <ref target="http://acip.princeton.edu/r3p2.html">Asian Classics Input Project </ref>, with which the OTA already
has links, continues to create and distribute a vast library of
Indo-Tibetan literature, recently expanded to include digital images
of collections of such material in St Petersburg.  Meanwhile, a team
from Dongguk University in Korea has been quietly developing their own
XML-aware Unicode editor for inputting the Korean Tipitaka, which may
well turn out to have wider application, if it ever gets out of Korea; unfortunately I couldn't find out as much about this as I wanted to:  <ref target="http://pdalgo.dongguk.ac.kr/~sadwolf/paper/paper.html">this paper</ref> describing it is in Korean.
</p>
   <p>In another tribute to the lure of XML, Charles Muller (Toyo
Gakuen University) recounted his experience in converting his <ref target="http://www.human.toyogakuen-u.ac.jp/~acmuller/bdict.htm">Dictionary of East
Asian Buddist terms </ref> into XML, using XSL to render it via Internet
Explorer 5. The possibilities thus opened up of linking this
dictionary with other resources such as the <ref target="http://home.earthlink.net/~rangjung/rypub/ry-dic.htm">Rangjung Yeshe Tibetan English dictionary of Buddhist culture </ref> attracted much interest. Christian
Wittern gave an excellent account of how encoding projects like CBETA
could make use of the TEI which last he described in a memorable
phrase as being "a travel guide not a catechism"; he uses <ref target="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/3871/ue.html">UltraEdit</ref>, a
programmable two-byte aware editor, to input and tag the Chinese
corpus according to a modified TEI Lite, and delivers the result for
browsing via Microsoft's free HTML Help wizard (an ingenious idea I
propose to steal).
</p>
   <p>My account necessarily omits whole strands ofthe conference
devoted to broader non-textual collections of cultural artefacts, and
much discussion of the opportunities afforded by the fusion of
networking and digital library, as well as some of the more specialist
topics discussed, simply because one cannot be in two places at
once. Nevertheless, I hope I have given some sense of the diversity
and richness of this exceptional conference.
