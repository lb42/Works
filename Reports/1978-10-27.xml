IDMS User Group Executive Meeting</head>
   <p>This was the first meeting
of the new executive committee of the ICL IDMS User Group. I have
represented Oxford at this group sporadically since it was set up in
1977, and was recently elected Chairman of the Fortran User's
Subgroup, which qualifies me to sit on the Executive,ta ran ta
ra.</p>
   <p>The main business of the meeting was to re-define the
structure of the group and aportion responsibilities for that new
structure. It was decided that the group's name should be changed to
'Data Management' group, reflecting the wider interests of the
majority of the group and also providing a better interface to ICL:
the group could function better as a pressure group if it covered a
range of ICL products.</p>
   <p>At the end of the meeting, four
sub-groups were defined: TP (chairman John Ladley, M.O.D.) to deal
with all aspects of data management in a TP environment, particularily
with respect to recovery; DDS (chairman P.M.Shearer, West Midlands
Gas) to deal with all aspects of Data Dictionary System and allied
products; IDMS DDL (chairman Geoff Baker, Consultant CACI) to deal
with DDL aspects of IDMS, i.e. the in-line software; IDMS DML
(chairman Me) to deal with DML aspects of IDMS, i.e. the programmer
interface, from all Host languages. The four chairman, together with a
chairman (John Dicker,BBC), treasurer and 1900 Representative
constitute the Executive.</p>
   <p>Terms of reference for all 4 subgroups
were discussed. They are to be submitted to the main user group for
ratification, as are the proposed changes in the group's
structure.</p>
   <p>Application for affiliation with the group from the
South African IDMS User's Group was believed to be imminent.- The
executive voted to reject the application 3 to 1; fortunately no
application had in fact been received.</p>
   <p>A discussion of the
group's relationship with the 2900 User Group established that there
was little commonality, and hence, little conflict, of interest
between the two bodies: ICL however required that members of working
parties set up by the Data Management group (to which confidential
information might be made available) should also be members of the
2900 User Group.</p>
