   <head type="report">VISIT REPORT 10 Royai
National Hotel 13 June 1985</head>
   <head type="event">ICL DMUG/LSUG
</head>
   <p>This was the first joint meeting of two of the larger ICL
user groups (Data Management and Large Systems) which are to
amalgamate in line with reorganisation within ICL later this year. It
began with reports from three working parties of DMUG (LSUG doesn't
seem to have any) which are to be published shortlyThe DOS Subgroup s
report sounded interesting: it makes recommendations about good
practise and proposes some major enhancements, notably interfaces
between DOS and graphics packages and text retrieval systemsThe IDM3X
subgroup's report, being largely about what to do when your corporate
database is so huge and complex your subschemas are too big for the
Cobol compiler, sounded less interesting: apparently 29 enhancements
to IDHSX are detailed in it. The Applications Generation Subgroup is
responsible for something called "4GL" which turns out to mean
Application Master and Report Master (but not RCI); its spokesman
didnt get much time to do more than say that although their report was
being printed and did describe some of the shortcomings of AM, they
did not feel their work was half begun yet.</p>
   <p>These reports were
followed by three presentations, two short and commercial, one long
and less so. A man from Cincom, the company which gave you TOTAL (a dbms
so antiquated it has 16 years experience in the field), gave quite an
impressive condensed sales pitch for MANTIS. This is a fast selling 4th
Generation system now available for VME machines as well as Honeywell,
IBM, VAX..The next release (but not this one) will use ICL s IDMS and
DOS underneath; it has its own dbms which supports a methodology not a
million miles from SSADM; also its own procedural programming language
described endearingly if obscurely as a "mix of Basic, PL/1, Pascal
and APL"Equally ingenuously, the man said that it was a high
performance system because it was "compile-free" i.e interpretive : a
clanger which all subsequent speakers picked up.</p>
   <p>Second sales
pitch of the day was for MINER, oxymoronically described by someone
called Mel from Savant Enterprises as "the software machine". Mimer
hails from Uppsala University (one of the world's leading software
research centres according to Mel, who hails from Croydon) and is not
just a 4th generation package; on the contrary, "Mimer is ready to
move to 5th and 6th generation systems". Such technical details as did
appear amongst the hype were that the system is based on B-trees and
uses lots of virtual memory (this tactic was grounds for the assertion
that MIMER is "usually faster than IDMS with CAFS"); also that there
was no need to reorganise the B-tree indexes because they were
"automatically self-balancing". It probably is quite a good package, but
putting a nice screen front end on it doesnt make it a 4GL in my
book.</p>
   <p>Highlight of the day was undoubtely a presentation
(complete with live demo) by Chris Worsley from the Electricity
Council of their very own home-grown ECLIPSE ("Electricity Council s
Integrated Programming Systems Environment" - of course). The EC is
responsible for collating and reporting to Government on the vast
amounts of information produced by the different Electricity Boards,
all of which (at least until recently) had
completely independent data management policies, never mind the
mixture of pcs, mainframes, IBM, ICL, etc. A common equipment policy has
now been decided upon (which incidentally features CAFS heavily), but
the evolution of a corporate database is still going on. The problem
with ICL's DDS (which Worsley otherwise considered "superb") was that
there was no automatic connexion betwen the top and bottom halves of
the quadrant. ECLIPSE uses a code generator called DELTA (not sure where
it comes from) to transform <pb facs="https://github.com/lb42/Works/tree/master/Reports/Pages/img471.jpg"/> essentially documentary
specifications into code (COBOL, SCL etc) appropriate to all sorts of
machines. The novel thing in all this is that the ECLIPSE user is
specifically disallowed access to any interface beyond documentation!
Code is described in terms of LUPOs and LAMs; the system generates
Delta code from this, which is in turn transformed into Cobol ,
Fortran, PL/1 etc. Local coding standards are rigidly enforced:
attempted violations of them (such as the use of GOTOs or introduction
of DML) will not be compiled. The demonstration showed how simple it
was to set up a typical application, using a menu-driven screen
painter like ISDA but rather smarter. A nice touch was that the Report
Generator looked very much like the Screen Painter. The package is to be
marketed by CAP.</p>
   <p>After a reasonable lunch (waiter service, hot
chicken, cold profiteroles, but not enough wine), assorted ICL hacks
took the stand. John Sale presented a paper (attached) about release
dates and product versions: some kerfuffle was provoked by the
withdrawal of support for VHE 8.01 at the end of June, of which many
present claimed to be unaware, likewise by the continued
non-appearance of QM250, Peter Kirby gave a bland but unexceptionable
chat about future trends within DOS, using the word "motherhood" (in
the sense "platitude") several times, which I have not come across in
an English speaker before. A recent NCC survey had shown that the
proportion of ICL users using DDS was far higher than the proportion
of non ICL users using any comparable product: this shows either that
DDS is a market leader, or that IBM users are a bunch of wallies, or
(most likely) that it is quite difficult to avoid using DDS if you are
an ICL shop. Amongst the DDS enhancements specifically mentioned as in
the pipeline were support for multiple projects, improved performance,
text retrieval facilities, national language capabilities and (most
interesting) a tailorable set of screen interfaces to allow for
distributed processing at graphics workstations, document preparation
systems etc.</p>
   <p>Guy Haworth here took to the podium and gave a
bright and breezy slide show (featuring I regret to say an aerial view
of our very own dreaming spires cheek by jowl with a picture of QMC s
IRAS satellite) about how absolutely wonderful CAFS was. He described
the chief products (remembering to mention that CSO is only COBOL
compatible) and showed pictures of the various industry gongs (now
numbering three) which CAFS has collected so far.</p>
   <p>The day closed
with a presentation, again including a live dem, by Andrew Walker of
the long awaited QUICKBUILD, now mysteriously called Quickbuild
Pathway, which is not (except perhaps metaphorically) a new sort of
concrete, but the latest all-singing all-dancing ICL user-interface to
AM, QM, DDS, 1DMS etc etc. All the tedium of entering data into the
dictionary, generating guery views, applications, schemas etc is
lumped together into this product, together with a nice friendly
screen driven interface with built-in help. It also, if I heard aright,
generates default database definitions directly from the business
model definitions, thus at last crossing from top to bottom half of
the dictionary. I think we should order a copy, so long as it's
free.</p>
