   <head type="event">1) Attend ICL IDMS User
Group Meeting; 2)Discuss data management facilities on 2900 and
exchange experience.</head>
   <p>Minutes of the User Group meeting will
be circulated within the next month,when they become available: a
brief summary only is given here. The meeting was attended by
representatives from MOD, BBC, GPO, HSA, BNF, UKAEA, Pirelli, ICL and
other interested parties. Reports on the current status of 2900 IDMS
implementation were given by ERCC, MOD, HSA and BBC. Several other
representatives had recently implemented 1900 IDMS as well, with
little difficulty.</p>
   <p>A discussion was held on a working paper from
MOD about proposed enhancements to the inline software of the next
version of ICL IDMS (B150). A paper was also circulated giving -
unofficially - ICL's planned enhancements. MOD confirmed that ICL had
committed itself to supplying them with at least two of the major
enhancements 'by mid 1977'. The discussion was fruitful, but
technical. Copies of the paper discussed are available. Topics
discussed included a fast-load utility (to be implemented in the next
Cullinane release), and the need for a report generator/queue
language. With the exception only of myself and the ERCC
representative the User Group favoured an interface between IDMS and
the FILETAB system.</p>
   <p>Reports were made on the European and
U.S. IDMS User Groups. A representative from Cullinane Corporation
reported on the developÂ­ments planned for their IDMS, and confirmed
that compatibility with the ICL product remained a high
priority.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately few of the people I met at ERCC had had
much experience of the Data Management facilities on 2900, nor did
they anticipate that there would be great user demand for any but the
more rudimentary of the DMUS, not, at least, until the package had
been more rigorously tested. This view was shared by the others at the
IDMS UG, in particular MOD Bureau West, one of whose representatives
told me he had used the DMUS extensively but found the facilities too
restrictive to be of much use. At ERCC, there was considerable
enthusiasm for FAMULUS as a hierarchical file-handling package
alternative to IDMS; the conversion to 2900 from the IBM version at
UCL would be undertaken by the PLU.</p>
   <p>I also managed to discuss in
some detail a proposed application of IDMS at Oxford with
Dr. G. Stacey, which was of great use to me, and hopefully to the user
concerned as well.</p>
