Project DAVID workshop</head>

   <p>DAVID is a newly funded  project in structured programming and
document manipulation, based at the <ref target="http://www.di.uminho.pt/">University of
Minho's computer science department</ref> and funded by JNICT (Junta
Nacional de Investigação Científica e Tecnológica:
i.e. the Portuguese national research council).  Its goals are to build
on the department's expertise in formal methods and grammars, exploring
new ways of applying them to text processing and information handling.
To start the project off, they organized a three day workshop on
"Algebraic document processing" in Braga last week, inviting a small
number of guest speakers (myself, James Clark, and Sebastian Rahtz) to
share their ideas in a pleasantly relaxed environment. There were about
a dozen participants, mostly from the department itself, but also from
other Portuguese universities.</p>
   <p>I was asked to give an overview of SGML and then to describe the TEI
architecture and ways of using it. I took the opportunity of
reorganizing the standard TEI workshop slightly, also introducing a
little more technical content than usual. Following the now-traditional
account of the problems of realizing the full potential of electronic
texts, I presented a version of the <ref target="http://info.ox.ac.uk/ota/teip3sg/">Gentle
Introduction to SGML</ref> expanded to include all (but only) the SGML
features actually used in the TEI scheme. Sebastian Rahtz followed this
with a nicely contrasting account of the practical difficulties of
applying SGML in the production-line world of Elsevier's journals
division. Elsevier has committed itself to using SGML for the archival
storage of their several hundred scientific and technical journals,
using <ref target="http://www.elsevier.com/homepage/about/sgml/">a version of the ISO 12083 dtd</ref> with
various varyingly satisfactory accomodations to cope with the enormous
amounts of maths, graphics etc. needed. This policy is expected to pay
off in terms of re-usability, with such ventures as the
<ref target="http://www.elsevier.com/homepage/news/1996/science/">Science Online</ref> database due to start next
year, which will deliver full text of 300 scientific  journals on the
web, complete with links to relevant bibliographic databases and
abstracting services, for those well-enough funded to access them, at
least.  </p>
   <p>After lunch (pizza of course), I gave <ref target="http://info.ox.ac.uk/ota/teij31/">the
traditional TEI architecture presentation</ref>, focussing rather more
explicitly on the nitty gritty of its class system and how the
modularity of the dtd is implemented. I then gave the document analysis
presentation, followed by a group tagging exercise. This last was quite
successful, unexpectedly, since the text chosen as vehicle was an
obscure 17th century English political pamphlet, which several
participants found linguistically rather challenging. The first day
concluded with a brief account of the motivation for, and contents of, 
the TEI header, after which I was more than ready for a cool beer and
the obligatory bacalhao.</p>
   <p>Day two began with the audience's choice of TEI tagsets: offered a
choice of TEI-ana, TEI-spoken, and <ref target="http://info.ox.ac.uk/ota/teilite/">TEI-lite</ref>,
they plumped for the first two, which is what I duly gave them. This was
a pleasant change, for me at least; in retrospect it's a great shame
that I had not prepared more on the feature structure tagset, since such
mention as I was able to make of it was clearly of considerable interest
to this audience.  I concluded my presentations with a brisk canter
through available SGML tools and strategies for handling TEI texts.</p>
   <p>James Clark then  improved considerably on my superficial account of
what a parser does by giving a detailed presentation of his
<ref target="http://www.jclark.com/sp/">SP parser,</ref> complete with some glimpses of
its 60,000 lines of C++ code. The new version of SP implements
everything defined in ISO 8879, even the silly bits. Unlike his earlier
parser, sgmls, it supports multi-byte character sets such as Unicode,
maintains non-ESIS information such as comments and use of white space,
and also allows for modification of the concrete syntax. It is also
reportedly at least twice as fast. SP is actually a general purpose C++
class library, with a well defined entity manager, and comes with a
number of useful implementations; it is completely free of charge, and
has already been incorporated into a number of leading SGML products
(notably Technoteacher, Balise, and Microstar's SGML Author for Word).</p>
   <p>After lunch, Sebastian Rahtz' second presentation described an
ingenious approach to the rather unusual problem created by Elsevier's
document management policies: the need to convert from LaTeX into SGML
(rather than the more usual reverse). Authors' use of LaTeX varied so
much, and LaTeX itself was so flexible, that in some cases it would be
cheaper to throw away the author's source and retype it from scratch, or
to throw away the TeX markup and retag it. Automatic conversions based
on parser technology inevitably fell foul of the macro-processing nature
of the TeX system sooner or later, and so the optimum solution seemed to
be to use TeX itself to process the input, but tweak its macros  so as
to emit appropriate SGML tagging along with the formatted text. Probably
you have to be a TeX hacker of Sebastian's expertise to even think of
this solution, let alone to implement it, but it does apparently work
more reliably than any of the alternatives. Sebastian also outlined
various strategies for presenting maths on the web and tried very hard
to persuade us that using PDF was a good idea. </p>
   <p>Day three was mostly devoted to <ref target="http://www.jclark.com/dsssl/">DSSSL</ref>, the
new Document Style Specification and Semantics Language, ISO 10179. José
Ramalho from Braga began with a brief overview of the contents of this
important new standard, which complements the standard syntax offered by
SGML with a standard way of defining its semantics. DSSSL has four
components: a language and a processing model  for transforming one SGML
document into another; a query language called SDQL for identifying
portions of an SGML document; a style language for applying formatting
characteristics to an SGML document, expressed in terms of things called
"flow objects"; and a powerful expression language derived from SCHEME
which ties the whole thing together.</p>
   <p>James Clark then presented his new  piece of software: JADE
(believed to be short for <ref target="http://www.jclark.com/jade/">James's  Awesome DSSL
Engine</ref>). He began with an impressive proof of concept which
involved converting the 300 pages of the DSSSL standard itself directly
into RTF before our very eyes, and showing the results, but then
descended (or ascended) to showing us large amounts of the code in Jade.
I regret to report that my comprehension of object-oriented techniques, 
already somewhat overstretched,  did not allow me to follow as much of
this as it should: but the availability of  a DSSSL style sheet for TEI
texts (on which work is currently proceeding) will no doubt change this.</p>
   <p>After lunch,  Jocelyn Payne described a system he has developed
called <ref target="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~popx/webomatic.html">Web-o-matic</ref>, which appears to be a way of
doing what most people do with CGI scripts but using object-oriented
Rexx. The system is used by a <ref target="http://ww2.ifs.org.uk/byoc/storysofar.htm">do-it-yourself economic
modelling web site </ref> at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It
wasn't clear to me what the point of this approach might be, but it's
always nice to hear what Jocelyn is actually up to. I wonder whether he
knows that at least three internet service providers use the term
web-o-matic to describe their tacky home-page creating scripts? </p>
   <p>Finally, Pedro Henriquez and José João Almeida  gave
an overview of their plans for<ref target="http://www.di.uminho.pt/~jcr/projectos/david/princ.html"> the DAVID project</ref>.
They have three years funding from JNICT, the Portuguese government
research funding agency, to explore new techniques and ideas in textual
information and processing. Their strong background in language
processing, with a corresponding emphasis on representation of meaning
as abstract syntax trees, together with their large resources of
programming skills (they have already developed a specification language
and prototyping environment called <ref target="http://www.di.uminho.pt/~lsb/camila.html">Camila</ref>,
and applied it to the task of defining a `literate programming'
application) clearly give them a head start (over me at least) in
understanding DSSSL and applying it to new and interesting areas.</p>
   <p>This was an unusual workshop, with a high degree of technical
content in a pleasantly relaxed atmosphere. For me, it was also a
comparatively painless way of finding out what the excitement about
DSSSL is all about; my thanks are due to the organizers and to my
co-speakers for making this an occasion to remember.</p>
