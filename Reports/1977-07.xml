   <head>QUARTERLY REPORT L. Burnard: July 1st
1977 â€“ December 31st 1977</head>
   <p>English Texts</p>
   <p>Work on the
Archive continued through the summer. Texts were received from
Cambridge, Edinburgh and Minnesota, and sent to Warwick, Edinburgh,
Leuven and Swansea. From Minnesota came the nucleus of the Coleridge
corpus, currently being completed. Lovely Mrs. J. Healey began typing
the rest of this in July and had got to page 400 by September, when
the money ran out. Proof reading and correction of the bulk of this
corpus is now well advanced. Other texts received included three from
UMRCC which came in the unlikely form of 7-track Atlas coded paper
tape. I wrote a program to convert these to EBCDIC, which appears to
be working. Another conversion program was written to translate 1900
code with shift characters (which are ignored by MT-READ) into
EBCDIC. A machine-readable catalogue of the Archive was begun in
December. Considerable interest in the Archive was expressed at the
various international meetings Susan and I attended last year, and
large amounts of texts were, as ever, promised. Work on a program for
collating textual variants and grouping them for cluster analysis
began in October.</p>
   <p>SPITBOL</p>
   <p>Most of September was spent
nervously preparing myself to give a course encouragingly titled
'Advanced use of Spitbol'. In the event, this proved quite successful,
in that attendance actually increased over the four weeks, and there
has been continued demand for the course notes. Some of those who came
were not arts-users. A new version of the SPITBOL compiler is expected
daily. A tape bearing 2900 Snobol arrived this month from Kent, just
too late to be of much use -for the present.</p>
   <p>FAMULUS</p>
   <p>Three
or four minor bugs were fixed and a major enhancement carried out to
the sorting routines last year. The enhancement allows for non-sorting
characters (e.g. accents) to be specified, and necessitating the
recompilation and re-organization of the subroutine library. Two
programs were written to assist particular users get their heart's
desire (as opposed to more or less what they wanted) out of the
package. 2900 Famulus did not materialise.</p>
   <p>IDMS</p>
   <p>Progress
has not been rapid, nor indeed clearly visable. Some real swan data
has been punched and re-formatted a few times. My knowledge of COBOL
has increased from the pathetically inadequate to the merely
risible. I attended the AGM of the User Group at which, inter alia, it
was agreed to set up a FORTRAN user's sub-group. I will be going to
Bracknell to get some experience of the FORTRAN interface (FISS) this
month by helping in something known as 'beta-testing1.</p>
   <p>Any Other
Business</p>
   <p>OXEYE was issued to Aston and the installation test run
successfully last month. I became a budget advisor at the end of
September. I wrote impeccably biassed minutes for the Programmers
monthly meetings. I attended the 4th International Summer School in
Computational and Mathematical Linguistics in August in Pisa, a
meeting of the BCS where I hoped (but failed) to see blood in a
confrontation between implementors of Spitbol and Snobol, and the
International Meeting/AGM of the ALLC in Liege in December. Visit
reports were written.</p>
