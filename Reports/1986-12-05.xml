   <p>Batelle Software (aka Information Dimensions Ltd)
is a recently created offshoot of the Batelle Memorial Institute; the
latter was set up in 1929 by one Gordon Batelle, a wealthy ex-miner,
in whose will it was charged to undertake research "for the good of
mankind". It now describes itself as the "world's largest private
research company" and can lay claim to having benefited mankind by the
invention of (inter alia) the Xerox machine, Snopake and
bar-coding. BASIS, a market leader in text retrieval software, was
originally (early 60s) an in-house product used to keep track of the
Institute's voluminous research project reports; DM, modestly
described as an improvement on all existing relational database
management systems, is a more recent product, developed over the last
six years from BASIS.</p>
   <p>The seminar was in two parts, each
consisting of a fairly technical run through followed by a
demonstration. It was one of a series of small and (as it transpired)
rather well run seminars which the company has been running this month
to raise its UK visibility somewhat; there were about six attendees
apart from ourselves.</p>
   <p>DM runs on CDC and DEC machines and is due
to be ported to IBM next year. At first glance it looks like a fairly
traditional ANSI/SPARC three level architecture DBMS, with a
structural data model, an "actual" (i.e. logical) data model and one
or more user data models. It supports concurrent access - up to 511
per "kernel" (i.e. database virtual machine) against 250 databases,
with up to eight kernels per mainframe; it comes with COBOL or Fortran
pre-processors, has good screen handling facilities, a
reasonable-looking report writer, and extensive security, recovery and
journalising features etc. It has a built-in data dictionary which is
used to enforce referential integrity. It has its own system language
(FQM) which is similar to but not the same as SQL; in particular it
does not contain facilities to create new views or relations. When
pressed, Batelle insist that when the product is enhanced to support
SQL (supposedly real soon now) it will support a full SQL including
such facilities. On the other hand FQM supports text items far more
effectively and usefully than SQL.</p>
   <p>BASIS is a well established
text retrieval system (major users include BT, BP, the Smithsonian
Institute, Pergamon Infoline and Reuters, not to mention the Houses of
Parliament or President Reagan's personal VAX). It is also used as a
component of Wang's Office Systems and of a turnkey library system; in
the shape of Micro-BASIS it is also being licensed to various CD-ROM
publishers. Its indexing strategies (there are twenty different
algorithms) appear to be sufficiently flexible to cater for almost any
sort of text or user requirement thereof, including support for funny
alphabets, embedded ignore characters etc.</p>
   <pb facs="Pages/img478.jpg"/>
   <p>Stop/Go words can be specified. Phrases
can be indexed. Subfields within text can be indexed (e.g. if one
field of a report contains a table, each row of the table can be
indexed distinctly). More than one search unit can be specified for
the same file, though not of course dynamically. The package has a
reasonable screen interface, with a tolerable procedural language used
to hook sets of commands together. It has a built-in thesaurus
capability which can be user-modified, an online editor and a
reasonably flexible and relaxed batch input system. Like most such
systems, it uses an unindexed holding-file for recent data; access to
the main text base is not possible while it is being updated.</p>
   <p>On
the whole I was favourably impressed by both systems. In particular,
DM seems the only serious contender for the role of DBMS on CDC
hardware, while BASIS is certainly worth consideration for the role of
text searching software on DEC Amdahl or CDC hardware. Both products
are far from cheap: DM with all its bells and whistles for a Cyber 855
would cost over £40k; while the basic module of BASIS would cost over
£6k even on a micro VAX and might be twice as much on a
mainframe.</p>
