Meeting/AGM of the Association for Literary and Linguistic

   <p>The theme of this year's
International Meeting was 'Computational Stylistics' and four related
papers were delivered. The first, by Prof R Bailey (Ann Arbor,
Michigan) outlined three different types of application for
computational methoddi in literary studies. The first (data retrieval)
was flourishing to the point (Prof Bailey confidently asserted) when
all the concordances man could ever need would soon have been
produced. The second was in the construction of models, where he felt
the computer tended to be used solely in support of the "limited
conceptual framework of the New Criticism" without exploring
alterative representations of the creative process such as those of
the Moscow school of Soviet semioticians. Prof Bailey also made the
(to my mind somewhat tendentious) assertion that the study of the
Humanities, like that of the Sciences, is cumulative and
hierarchic. His third type, the use of statistical and other methods
for testing widely-held if unproven hypotheses was exemplified by the
third speaker, Dr Kenny. The second speaker was Dr P Boyde (St Johns
College,Cambridge) who spoke in rather more general terms about the
Computer's Temptations. He made the intresting suggestion that a
poetic sensibility, such as his own, was almost of necessity
innumerate and also propounded Boyle's Law, viz that three examples of
anything were necessary to convince a Humanist - one or two being too
few, and four far too many. Unfortunately, since he then proceeded to
give some­thing like 5 examples of ways in which computers confused
him, I fear I lost interest. Dr A Kenny (Balliol) provided a sharp
contrast by distributing three pages of statistical tables derived
from his current research into the authorship of the 14 books of
Aristotle's Metaphysics, using similar techniques to those described
in his recent book on the authorship of the Ethics. After lunch,
during which I tried but failed to persuade a representative of the
Kraus-Thomson Organisation that the future lay in fiche, Prof James
Joyce (no relation) of the University of California described his
application of a computational network model to the Mediaeval poem
Pearl*s rhyming scheme. Prof Joyce considered that the most frequently
traversed nodes in his network corresponded with words of semantic
significance in the poem. The argument was somewhat vitiated by Prof
Joyce's inability to remember what some of the words in the poem
meant, and also by his refusal to recognise the formulaic nature of
much mediaeval verse, but the applicability of such a model seemed
good.</p>
   <p>The AGM of the ALLC which followed consisted of the usual
tabling of reports from representatives around the globe, the usual
fulsome praise for the officers of the society, and the usual promises
that the Bulletin of the Society would appear more regularly in the
future. Since Susan was appointed editor at the last committee
meeting, it seems probable that this may actually occur.</p>
