   <head type="event"> Colloqium on Hypertexts and Electronic
Editing</head>
   <head type="location"> École Normale Superieure, Paris</head>
   <head type="date">  12-14 September 1996</head>

   <p>This three day colloqium  was hosted  in Paris by Jean-Louis
Lebrave of the <ref target="http://www.ens.fr/item/Welcome.html">Institut des textes et
manuscrits modernes (ITEM)</ref>, with funding from the CNRS under a
programme called  <hi>Le Patrimoine Ecrit</hi> or Written Heritage,
managed by Almuth Grésillon. It  brought together an unusually
wide-ranging group of European researchers and implementors, many of
whom were previously unknown to me, and all of whom had something
interesting to demonstrate or to say about using hypertextual methods in
the process of critical editing or electronic publication. Most of the
presentations involved web-hosted demonstrations, displayed on a huge
screen in a darkened room, fitted with exceedingly comfortable
cinema-style armchairs.  I learned that the French for "web" is <hi>toile</hi>,
which also means canvas, as well as being a slang term for the cinema
screen. After a rather good lunch,  it is testimony to the rhetorical
skills of the presenters that no-one visibly fell asleep in such
surroundings.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, local committments made it impossible for me to
attend the first day's sessions. According to David Robey (who
turned out to be the only other brit present), they were rather
theoretical and lacking in focus, but I was sorry to have missed meeting
Bernard Stiegler. The second day began with Etienne
Brunet, <ref target="http://lolita.unice.fr/">(UPRESA, University of Nice)</ref> a
founder member of the ALLC and author of the <ref target="http://134.59.31.3/~brunet/PUB/hyperbase.html">Hyperbase
concordance system</ref>, describing his Balzac cd-rom project. This
will make available 90% of <hi>La Comédie Humaine</hi> 
(Balzac's monster sequence of 19th c novels) --- once the copyright
problems have been ironed out. More interestingly, the project is a
collaborative one, in which 33 international Balzac scholars are
scheduled to produce notes, commentary, and assorted links. Brunet
suggested  that the online text was really there as a way of indexing
the collection of associated Balzacian commentary. <ref target="http://134.59.31.1/~brunet/BALZAC/">The
web site</ref> has some interesting Balzaciana, including photos of 
the great man's walking sticks as well as his  manuscripts. It also has
a KWIC concordance, carved up into HTML, with each line of context
linked automatically to the passage in the complete text from which it
comes, and some rather impressive statistical displays. </p>
   <p>Luca Toschi from the CRAIAT research group at the
University of Florence prefixed his demonstrations with some suggestive
thoughts on the ways in which digitizations facilitated many views of a
text, based on his experience with the publication of an electronic
Goldoni variorum. I found the software, when we finally saw it, rather
impressive: it displays each state of the text separately, but with
variant passages colour coded. Clicking on one of these then brings up
the state of the text in which that variant appears, as a new window.
They use an IBM product called Linkway Live (?).</p>
   <p>Paolo d'Iorio (Paris) described how the web had
effectively created <ref target="http://www.usc.edu/dept/annenberg/thomas/nietzche.html">an enormous, multinational,
multilingual, Nietzche database.</ref>  His chief focus was on the way
the web made  co-operative authoring ventures possible, but he also gave
some nice examples of ms images linked to transcriptions. Asked
whysomeone didn't just publish everything on CD, he stressed the open,
dynamic, nature of the enterprise; in similar vein, when asked whether
he didn't fear that this kind of community would create some new kind of
orthodoxy, he pointed out  that the dissidents were perfectly free to
set up webs linked to the same material, displaying it in their prefered
way. </p>
   <p>Daniel Ferrer (also from ITEM) gave a considered
presentation of the advantages of Storyspace in presenting the evolution
of the text of Joyce's <hi>Ulysses</hi>  through the various
states of manuscript, typescript, correction, page proofs, etc. The
database includes Gabler's transcription as well as a sets
of page images; much play was made of the difficulty of linking
non-rectangular zones of Joyce's scrawl in the latter with parts of the
former. The Joycean theme was picked up by <ref target="http://www.interport.net/~xaf">Marlena
Corcoran</ref>, who demonstrated the importance of good design
and a simple interface in a system (developed with mediatool)  which
allowed one to see  the corrected original page proofs <hi>(placards</hi>)
of<hi> Ulysses</hi> , as they appeared before they were cut up by
some over-zealous conservator, and thus to infer something about the
correction process itself. </p>
   <p>Nicole Moulinoux from the University of Rennes
described another scholarly collaboration centred on the works of
William Faulkner, in particular a web based (but password-protected for
copyright reasons) electronic variorum of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> .
Another member of the team showed a comprehensive set of retrieval and
statistical tools aimed (I think) at content analysis, which had used
the text: the unusual feature of this was the provision of dynamically
generated tables of hits retrieved according to an unexplained factor
analysis. This seemed to offer a lot of possibilities for stylistic
analysis.</p>
   <p>Alain Giffart (IMEC) discussed a new project at the
Collège de France to create a hypertextual edition of Roland
Barthes' <hi>Comment vivre ensemble</hi> . His discussion was wide
ranging and highly theoretical. If hypertext has a theory (and it must
have, for the French to take it seriously) then Barthes anticipated most
of it. It will be interesting to see what the project produces: the
Barthes archive includes video and audio of the lectures from which his
published works derive, made at different times. Extending the
geneticist school of textual criticism to cope with such materials poses
interesting challenges.</p>
   <p>Peter Szendi (IRCAM) presented what he called a
<hi>maquette diaboliciel (</hi>or diabolical pilot program) -- a
prototype for an exploration of the variations within and between
versions of Beethoven's <hi>Diabelli Variations</hi> , in which
the scores were linked to an audio track. For some reason his comment
that it should be possible to find some auditory equivalent of the
clickable button (to indicate an anchor within an audio track) provoked
heated dissent from the audience. </p>
   <p>I opened the final day of the Colloqium by presenting the usual
overview of the TEI architecture in my best A-level French, somewhat
enhanced by  illustrations of how to do hypertext-y things in TEI,
including the Comenius example, and also for good measure two different
ways of encoding the start of the Beowulf ms. I was also able to wave a
copy of the newly published edition of <hi>Cahiers Gutenberg</hi> 
containing Francois Role's <ref target="http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/pub/GUTenberg/publications/">French
translation of the TEI Lite tutorial.</ref> Which was, as they say,
nice.</p>
   <p>David Robey (Manchester) followed this up by
describing his experience as a member of a TEI work group, and
presenting his views on how to tag the rhyme and alliteration patterns
in Dante's <hi>Inferno</hi> . This provoked an interesting
argument about the extent to which algorithmically or procedurally
determined patterns needed to be made explicit in an encoding. </p>
   <p>David Pietrowski and Georges Vignaux
(INALF/LIMSI) described a prototype system for use in tracking reading
of a dictionary, specifically the <hi>Grand Robert</hi> .This was
presented as a way of creating a new perspective on language rather than
a neat way of capturing the reading process itself, which might have
been more persuasive.</p>
   <p>A team from Saarbrucken, led by one Wender, gave  a
brief overview of a rather fine Goethe project. This <ref target="http://schiller.germanistik.uni-sb.de/goethe/index.html">web site</ref> generates HTML on the fly from
their internal markup, combining text, manuscripts, and critical
apparatus in an impressive way. They are also working on Musil and
Buechner. The methodological problem they foregrounded was that of
making explicit the temporal stages of a series of variants. </p>
   <p>Alessandro Pamini (Istituto Metacultura) tried (twice)
to present a new hypertext system being developed in collaboration with
the Cultural Anthopology department of the University of Rome. His talk
was given in Italian, and all I gleaned from it was that he felt
everyone else had misunderstood the fundamental issues. (But he did
later hand out a French translation, which looks a lot more interesting)</p>
   <p>The colloquium concluded with a long and wide ranging round table
discussion in which several distinguished luminaries picked up some
themes of the colloqium, and introduced some new ones.  Hans-Walter
Gabler  (Munich), whose computer-assisted re-editing of Joyce
provoked some controversy a few years back, was quietly optimistic about
the possibilities offered by a true computer-based editing: I learned
later that he is currently planning a new graduate seminar on textual
criticism with a strong computational component. Yannick Maignien
of the Bibliotheque Nationale and  Robert Martin of the
Institut Nationale de la Langue Française raised several  key
issues about the opportunities and difficulties of electrronic text
provision (role of libraries, need for metadata, publishing, copyright,
etc).  Christine Coutoure, documentalist at the École
Normale, spoke feelingly of the librarian's perspective on the untamed
wilderness of the web.  Eric Lochard from Montpellier, 
Alain Giffard,  Jean-Louis Lebrave, and
Daniel Ferrer all in their separate ways questioned some
of the methodological implications of the hypertext method, and the
seductive availability of apparently neutral digital resources. There
was much debate, but I found most persuasive  Toschi's eloquent reminder
that whatever else scholars do, they should not abnegate their 
responsibility to spin a plausible tale. </p>
