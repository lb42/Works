Conference</head>

   <p>CHArt
- Computers in the History of Art - is a special interest group
organised by Prof. Will Vaughan at UCL and Dr Antony Hamber at
Birckbeck, with a burgeoning membership (about 150 attended this
conference) drawn rather more from the major national museums than
from academic departments. I attended its inaugural meeting nearly two
years ago mostly out of idle curiosity; I was invited to this, its
second annual conference, I suspect largely on the strength of my
performance at Westfield (historians of art seeming to overlap a
little with historians in general) on condition that I explain what
databases were in words of one syllable, preferably employing lots of
pictures.</p>
   <p>The conference was a two day event, with mornings
given over to formal presentations and afternoons to a number of
parallel demonstration sessions. In between was a very pleasant
reception featuring memorable dim sum. All around was the wealth of
the National Gallery; definitely among my favourite conference venues
to date. I opened the first day's formal sessions (which all concerned
cataloguing/database applications), using as my main example a page
from the Gallery's Catalogue written (I later learned) by the
distinguished old buffer who had formally welcomed us into said
gallery's hallowed portals not five minutes earlier. Fortunately he'd
left by the time I started to get personal. Colum Hourihane from the
Courtauld, where the only computer-assisted art historical cataloguing
of any importance is actually going on, then gave a very impressive
resume of every known method of iconographical classification. He'd
found eight different methods used to categorise the subjects of
images, of which the best appeared to be ICONCLASS, as used by, yes,
the Witt Library at the Courtauld. His paper, when written up, should
become a standard reference on the subject.</p>
   <p>After coffee in an
adjoining room of old masters, Jeanette Towey (described as 'a
researcher' and evidently not a sales person) gave a work-person-like
introduction to what word-processors are, how they differ from
typewriters etc. etc. She advocated Nota Bene, having used that and
Word Star, but had never tried Word Perfect nor heard of SGML, page
description languages or -mirabile dictu- TeX. Gertrude Prescott from
the Wellcome Institute and her 'data processing consultant' (whose
name I forgot to write down) then described their current prototype
cataloguing system for the Wellcome's immense collection of prints,
using dBase III+. It was rather depressing to see that although they
were starting from scratch - much of the collection never having been
catalogued in any way - their data analysis was very rudimentary. It
seemed to me to be over-reliant on dBase III's tendency to sweep
anything difficult under the carpet into a "MEMO" field, of which they
had about eight in one record. No doubt they will learn better from
the example of their neighbours at the Witt Library.</p>

   <p>After lunch, there were various
demonstrations, of Nota Bene (which I avoided) and of STIPPLE, our old
friend from the pigsty, which does not appear to have changed much and
which I am now close to thinking I understand. ERROS Computing is
still in business, but does not appear to have gained any new
customers since the last report, some 18 months ago, nor indeed to
have expanded its standard demo at all. Another demonstration, of
somewhat dubious relevance to Art History, was being given by a Dr
Alick Elitthorn from a private charity called PRIME (no relation to
any manufacturer) which has something to do with the analysis of
dreams. Its chief point of interest was that it used STATUS on a PC
AT, of which I have long heard but never actually seen. The software
costs Â£2000; by dint of sitting on my hands I prevented myself from
taking a security copy of it immediately. Day Two, which was supposed
to be on visual rather than historical aspects of the subject, was
opened by a Mr Duncan Davies (formerly with ICI, now retired) who gave
what was reported to have been a magnificent overview of the rise of
western civilisation. Owing to the caprices of British Rail, I missed
much of this, arriving only in time for the Reformation, from which
time, according to Dr Davies, may be dated the end of the period
during which written communication had constituted the intellectual
power base. With the rise of universal education came the stress on
words and numbers as the only fit means of communication, the
discouragement of the most able from visual forms of expression and
our consequent inability to say anything intelligent about visual
images. The second great invention of humanity, will be the pictorial
equivalent of the phonetic alphabet and if anyone had any ideas on how
it could be done, would they please telephone Dr Davies on
01-341-2421. The visual content of his talk, which my summary does not
attempt to include, was, of course, the better part. Terry Genin had
the difficult task of following this, but persevered, remarking that
he would normally be on playground duty rather than addressing a
gathering of this sort. He has developed some fairly straightforward
courseware involving image and colour manipulation on RM380Zs as a
means of teaching art history in a secondary schools but the bulk of
his talk was a plea for the possibilities of interactive video to be
more widely recognised in that context, (which seems to me to be a
political rather than an art historical question), rather than just as
a means of selling Domesday Book, of which he had several
(unspecified) criticisms.</p>
   <p>After coffee, Andrew Walter (IBM
Research) gave a rapid canter through the York Minster Computer
Graphics project. This is somewhat of a tour de force in CAD; it
consists of a model of the York Minster, sufficiently detailed for
views to be plotted from every angle both inside and outside. A video
of the resulting tour was on display throughout the conference; each
frame took about three hours CPU time on an IBM 3430, so interaction
was impossible. The presentation included samples of the high level
graphics language in which the Minster views were specified
(primitives such as cylinder, sphere, cube etc. are combined in a
procedural way) which was interesting though how much sense it made to
the majority of the audience I can only guess. Wire frame drawing with
dotted in-fill was presented as a more promising way of getting
interactive processor</p>
   <pb facs="Pages/img481.jpg"/>
   <p>speeds; the
problems of including perspective in the views were also touched
on.</p>
   <p>David Saunders (National Gallery) described an ingenious
application of image processing techniques. The problems of colour
changes in 16th century paint are fairly well known (Ucello didn't
actually paint blue grass, it's just that the yellow wash he put over
it has gone transparent); more modern pigments also change over
time. Usually the only way of telling what has happened is when a part
of the painting has been protected from light, e.g. behind the
frame. By storing carefully controlled digitised images of the
painting and the comparing them after a five year gap, the NG hopes to
identify more precisely what types of material are most at risk and
what factors cause most damage. The equipment (which was also
demonstrated in the afternoon) includes an HP 9836 frame store and a
special digitising camera. Several art historical applications of
image processing techniques were also given in what was, rather
unexpectedly, the most stimulating paper of the
conference.</p>
   <p>Finally, two ladies from the Weeg Computing Centre
at the University of Iowa described their videodisc retrieval
project. A library of about 18,000 colour slides had been stored (in
analogue form) on video disc, and a simple text DBMS (called
Info-Text) used to index them. The system was designed for use by
faculty members wishing to collect together appropriate illustrative
material. In the classroom, images can be projected in the same way as
conventional slides; the quality of the images (we were assured) was
"better than might be expected"; it looked reasonable on the standard
video monitors available at the National Gallery. Images are
catalogued according to nineteen different categories (date,
provenance, size etc.); no formal iconographic indexing was
used. Apart from the obvious advantages of being tougher and cheaper
to maintain, one great attraction of the system was seen to be its
integration of indexing and displaying comparable and contrasting
treatments of equivalent subjects.</p>
   <p>The conference closed with a
plenary discussion centre. This focussed at first on the difference
between the words "analogue" and "digital", rambled off into
ill-informed speculation about the possibility of automatic
subject-recognition and was brought to heel by a plea for more
information about what sort of database system was worth buying, and
whether or not art historians should be expected to get their brains
dirty trying to design them. My views on all these topics being fairly
predictable, I shall not summarise them here.</p>
