   <p>The Memoria Project's latest meeting was in Pisa on Monday and Tuesday
this week, but I decided to go early, partly to save the project 250
pounds in airfare, and partly in order to discuss with the
indispensable A. Zampolli the chance of getting more funds for the TEI
from Brussells under a call for proposals due to expire on 15 March
(gak).</p>
   <p>
I took a fly (as Alitalia likes to call them) from Gatwick at 0945
(which meant getting the 0558 train from Oxford) on Saturday, found
the leaning tower still unfallen, and basking in spring sunshine, and
Italy just as it should be. In the evening, after some prevarication,
Zampolli and I managed to dine and dine well at the Trattoria opposite
my hotel, but I was concentrating so much on the need to sort out the
politics of the TEI proposal that I don't remember any thing except
some truly unforgettable gnocchettini with cheese and basil sauce, and
a piece of fish with rather more olives attached than I had bargained
for.</p>
   <p>Sunday I went to Florence, partly for touristic reasons, but mainly to
persuade my old friend Dr A to write the BNC Handbook for me, which I
duly did over an excellent lunch in an obscure, but very crowded
fiaschetteria. This was the sort of Italian eating establishment I
like -- hams hanging from the ceiling, elbow-to-elbow diners all
shouting at the top of their voices, small children misbehaving with
indulgent grandparents, plates of food and bottles of chianti flying
everywhere. You eat what's on offer, and don't regret it. I had a
thick vegetable soup, a plate of prosciutto, and what would have been
a monstrously thick pork chop had it not been beef of a most succulent
and delicious nature. To walk it off, Dr A and I staggered through the
Boboli Gardens up to the Belvedere commanding magnificent views over
the town, before calling at someone's house for tea and cake as the
sun set, and we went our separate ways.</p>
   <p>On Monday, the Memoria meeting proper took place: Catherine Toussaint
from CAP who has taken charge of the project summarised what had
happened at the Project Review meeting in Luxembourg last week (not a
lot) and we discussed what exactly should go into Work package 4
(quite a bit). Lunch was unremarkable, but for dinner we went to my
other favourite sort of Italian restaurant -- the kind where the
proprietor welcomes you like a long lost relative and proceeds to
foist exotic and unlikely dishes on you, saying "but you must taste
this" and "what do you think of this?". Such establishments rarely
have more than four customers at a time, and are buried in obscure
side streets, but well worth the extra walk. I was seduced into trying
the home-smoked tunnyfish, followed by just a little oyster-mushroom
soup with crostini, followed by a main course composed mostly of small
pieces of roast marinated goose, rounded off with a pudding of baked
ricotta in lemon sauce, and an aromatic grappa. Exquisite is the word
that springs to mind. Also, filling.</p>
   <p>Day two of the meeting took place at the ILC in Pisa, and consisted
largely of a demo of image processing software by Andrea Bozzi and
friends. With the aid of a Quadra 7/50 and a box of transputers, they
can figure out where the words in a line of digitized medieval
manuscript begin and end and tie them up with a transcription of
it. There was also some discussion of what exactly should be presented
to the first meeting of the Special Interest group (to be constituted
next week), and a very instructive discussion of what exactly
Yannick Maignien meant in his description of the Memoria
"maquette". Also some bleating from me about how exactly OUCS was
supposed to carry out Work Package 3 in the absence of any input from
the other partners.  Lunch was a modest affair, (pasta in cream sauce,
followed by salad and chips) and very late but none the worse for
that. The rest of the afternoon I spent trying to connect to the BNC
server, with modest sucess, eventually; also trying to extract a copy
of the TEI conformant 30 million word corpus of modern Italian -- I
nearly got it, but not quite, before returning this evening.</p>
