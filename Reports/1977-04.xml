   <head>QUARTERLY REPORT L. Burnard</head>
   <p>April -
June 1977</p>
   <p>21 weeks this quarter were taken up by holiday and
official jubilation.</p>
   <p>Copies of OXEYE were sent to Minnesota and
to Birmingham. The SPITBOL system has remained unchanged and bug-free
so far this quarter. I gave a seminar on its use and on good SNOBOL
practise at University College Swansea, I also wrote a review of a
book on SNOBOL, which is to be published next term.</p>
   <p>The Oxford
Archive of English Literature, a data bank of literary texts in
machine readable form, was conceived and reached parturition this
quarter, despite endless problems with gummy pooltapes, defective tape
transports and inadequate software. Several letters have been written,
a meeting was held, tapes have been transferred. All texts known in
the 1906A filestore were collected together, dumped to tape, and lost
in a general restore.. Currently about 50 texts are being maintained
and a catalogue is in production. Hardware problems.form the chief
obstacles to progress.</p>
   <p>The IDMS installation test was
successfully run at Bath on May 6th. The swan database was moved there
successfully the same month, and a program to monitor its performance
ran once or twice before the machine went off the air. I am now
re-designing the entire system. I gave a Tuesday morning chat on IDMS
and also wrote a paper for the 2900 Technical Committee on the same
topic.</p>
   <p>Notable visits this quarter include two from ICL,
Mr. Dick Jukes of Management Training who gave valuable advice on
training in the use of IDMS and Mr. Tim Bourne who came to cast a
fatherly eye over the progress of the RSL Serials Project (currently
HALTED - WAITING FOR A STUDENT). I attended a course on literary
statistics run by Susan and the next Master of Balliol, and a
fascinating seminar on computational linguistics given by Professor
Yorick Wilks at St. Cross.</p>
