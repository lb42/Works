Group</head>

   <p>Security at Bureau West was 'Condition Black' for this
meeting, so I am allowed to divulge the following: there were
several new attendees</p>
   <p>from organisations as disparate as Western
Gas and RACAL Management Services; ICL gave a long and minutely
detailed presentation on techniques of IDMS sizing, including details
of useful publications available only from project teams; no response
was available from ICL on the subgroup's report (presented at last
meeting) but was promised for the next. In a more informal context, I
received advance documentation of a new 'user friendly' relational
system from Edinburgh (called ENUF), good advice on making one of the
current IDMS applications here more secure, and interesting gossip on
what Oxfordshire County Council are up to. (implementing an IDMS-based
Local Authority Financial Information System jointly with Doncaster
and ICL) </p>
