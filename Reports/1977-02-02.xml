IDMS USER GROUP </head>

   <p>Minutes of the meeting
are not yet available but will be produced on request when they
are. As normal, brief reports were made from those currently
implementing IDMS projects - which now includes BBC, Plessey, HSA,
Water Data Unit, ERCC and the MOD in various guises. No one had
anything but praise for the IDMS code, nor much to grumble about
except the eccentricities of System B. Other interested parties
present included representatives of the GPO, UKAEA, Mardon Son &amp;
Hall, Anglian Water Authority, Short Bros and. the Hong Kong
Government. The main business of the day was (a) a presentation, by
one D.A. "Nobby" Clarke of ICL on the newly released Data Dictionary
System and (b) proposals to re-organise the group - now an unwieldy
30+ in size.  a) . The Data Dictionary System is a newly released,
large (120+ Kb mainstore) expensive (no figures available yet) largely
undocumented (but TP 6426 is due in June) piece of software that no
system offering database facilities can afford to do without. Such was
my impression. It is essentially a database in containing information
about all aspects (data structure, physical placement, processes used
etc etd) of another database or databases, which can therefore be
continuously updated, and in which modifications to database design
can be exhaustively tested without corrupting the status quo. As a
design tool (and especially when starting a databse from scratch)
there is little doubt that the DOS methodology cannot as yet be
improved upon. One can of course use that methodology without using
the associated software! "Nobby" 's presentation demonstrated this
quite effectively by showing the simplicity of translation from an
'entity model' to DOS input, though he was less forthcoming about
output from the package. He particularly stressed how the use of an
'entity .model1 would draw attention to otherwise obfuscated
contradictions inherent in the structure of data. The DOS was machine
and application independent , and grand things were promised of it in
the future. In particular, the next release (DDS200 - in 3V 23J will
be able to generate IDMS Schema DDL or FML file DDL directly from the
'entity model' . CRISP (the Navy Stores &amp; Transport Inventory
Project) have been evaluating the DDS by carrying out field trials for
ICL, and they have also produced a comprehensive report on the
package. To quote their conclusions “The application of the DDS is
relevant to all ADP projects and the authors recommend that all 2900
series users adopt it at the earliest opportunity" and "The DDS is
still in its infancy with regard to its potential usefulness to the
user" . I have a copy of this report.  b) The IDMS user group formally
agreed to split into several smaller working parties dealing with
distinct areas where it was felt enhancements were necessary, to
discuss and make recommendations to ICL on those enhancements, and to
report back to the main group, which would meet at less frequent
intervals to discuss the subgroups' recommendations. First meetings
for the subgroups would be held- in the next month, and will report to
the next general group meeting in two months time. I propose to attend
a subgroup dealing with query language and report
generator. </p>
