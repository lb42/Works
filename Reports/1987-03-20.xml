Westfield College </head>
   <head type="when">20-21 March
1987</head>
   <head type="event">History and Computing - 2nd Annual
conference</head>
   <p>Westfield College campus begins increasingly to
resemble the set for some grimy Channel 4 documentary on the state of
British Education. The exteriors of its gracious 19th century
buildings are suffering a rash of desperate fly-posting while their
bare interiors remain un-redecorated and unloved. For this conference,
the ruins have put on a pretence of being inhabited still, which
somehow makes them all the more depressing. In an ambitious moment
twenty years ago, Westfield erected a functionalist science block,
derelict for the last few years since it lost its science department;
for this occasion it has been unlocked and its 'ground floor heating
switched on. Ghosts lurk in the corridors, however. Elsewhere, in what
was once a library, there are still a few comfortable chairs and a
non-stop coffee machine, but all the bookshelves are bare.</p>
   <p>Maybe
the atmosphere affected my judgement, or maybe it's just that it had a
hard act to follow, but I found this second conference less exciting
than the first one. There was the same extraordinarily broad-based
constituency of delegates, from secondary school teachers to academic
researchers, as well as a significant European presence (except for
the French who were conspicuously absent): the attendance list
includes nearly 500 people. There was also the same abundance of
material: around 250 papers crammed into two days of parallel
sessions. Considerable effort had been made to group papers on a
common theme into the same session, which encouraged more detailed and
informed discussion but discouraged the serendipity I had enjoyed at
the previous year's event. The distributed nature of Westfield's
surviving lecture rooms also made it very difficult for butterflies
like myself, once stuck in a group of rather limp papers on the
applications of Knowledge Based Systems in secondary education, to
escape to the parellel session on "Recent advances in historical
demography" which was clearly where the real action was going
on.</p>
   <p>There were two plenary sessions, of which I attended only
the first, which was a "keynote address" style lecture by Roderick
Floud. Prof Floud has been somewhat of a pioneer amongst computing
historians, having published an article advocating the use of
electronic card readers in 1973. His lecture was enthusiastic but
decently sober about the micro revolution, stressing that new tools
did not mean new methods. In the future, he was confident that data
input methods would remain a central problem, however advanced the
technology. He described what he called a "prompting data input
program" that had been developed for use in capturing US Army pension
records and demonstrated the <pb facs="Pages/img496.jpg"/> ease with
which data could be manipulated by a typical cheap micro
dbms/spreadsheet package (REFLEX, no less) and concluded with a plea
for historians to fights against the "mythology of
computing".</p>
   <p>As aforesaid, I made the mistake of choosing the
wrong session from the four parallel workshops offered next, from
which I gained nothing but a nice new acronym (MITSI - the Man In The
Street Interface). The third paper in this group was the best: it was
from a Portuguese scholar who had developed an expert system for
handling about 2000 depositions of "sinners" as recorded in 17th -
18th century ecclesiastical court records. Unfortunately Carvalho's
English was not up to the task of explaining a great deal of its inner
workings, though the principals seemed clear enough.</p>
   <p>I had no
choice in the next set of four: whatever the rival attractions of
"Urban and regional studies" (quite a bit), "Higher Education Seminar"
(rather less) or "Prosopographical studies" (rather more), I had to
attend the workshop on "Relational database method", if only because I
was giving the first paper in it. This (a rapid introduction to SQL
and the relational model using D. Greenstein's Philadelphia data as
example) had to be boiled down from about 2 hours worth of overheads
to a very fast 30 minutes, but it seemed to go down reasonably
well. Phil Hartland (RHBNC) then gave an unusually clear and
jargon-free exposition of the virtues of SSADM in managing large
projects: two intriguing examples he mentioned were a projected
history of the music hall and also a database about music in the 18th
century. Michael Gervers from Toronto ( one of the few non-Europeans
present) reported on his Pauline conversion to ORACLE in much the same
terms as last year: he has now produced some quite interesting results
about changes in the landholding status of Mediaeval textile
workers.</p>
   <p>Next day, I arrived in time for the last part of an
informal workshop on data standardisation chaired by Manfred Thaller,
which appeared to be making very little progress: someone was pleading
for a set of 'ethical guidelines'. After coffee, I plumped for the
session on "Problems of multiple record linkage", thus missing the
intellectual ("Recent advances in historical psephology"), the exotic
("Schools Education Seminar") and the ineluctable ("Academic word
processing" - a dizzying combination of Tex, Latex and Tustep). My
chosen session began with Arno Kitts' (Southampton) solid exposition
of the historical and methodological problems involved in accurately
linking together Portuguese names as they appear in 19th and 20th
century passport lists, electoral rolls, cemetery lists etc. The
object of the exercise is to determine patterns of emigration:
calculating for example the rates of return migration. The linkage
procedure should be completely automatic (he asserted) to avoid
subjectivity, but necessarily involved dictionary lookup for some more
widely varying name forms. None of these problems seemed to worry the
next speaker, our very own A. Rodriguez, whose record<pb facs="Pages/img497.jpg"/>linkage problems were virtually non
existent: her data consisting of some 8000 records of birth, marriages
and deaths in all of which surname, forenames, and father's names are
all obligingly present. Even SIR could cope with data as simple as
this: all that was necessary was a massive sort on the names, followed
by a forty line piece of procedural gibberish to insert links between
records with the same namestring present, written for her by the
obliging D. Doulton of Southampton, centre of SIR fanaticism in the
known universe. The last speaker, Ariane Mirabdobaghli (LSE) was using
Ingres to link 18th centurty parish and tax records: it was not at all
clear how, which is a pity.</p>
   <p>The remainder of the conference
consisted of five parallel sessions of five "research reports" each,
spaced out so as to permit session hopping. I managed to catch Dunk
(sic) and Rahtz (sic) on strategies for gravestone recordings (a
flatteringly familiar exercise in conceptual modelling); Dolezalek
(Frankfurt) on ways of reconstructing manuscript stemma (an
intriguing, if apparently hopeless text); Nault (Montreal) on an
enormous historical demography project at Quebec (births and marriages
of every individual betwen 1608 and 1729) - being stuck with a Cyber
70 they had to write their own dbms, but seem to be doing quite well
with it; and finally, Lamm (Birkbeck) who has been let into the MOD's
secret archive of first world war soldiers' records with an Epson
portable. He is using this to extract a minute random sample of about
8000 records, about thirty variables (height, age, length of service
etc) from the attestation papers, personal correspondence, war
records, pension and medical books etc etc here stored away on some
64,000 feet of shelfspace. I found it rather depressing that this
numerically recoded set of SPSS data would probably be all that
remained of this archive by the time it was made public in 1995, the
rest - already damaged by fire- having long since crumbled to
dust. But my friend from the Public Record Office seemed quite
relieved at the prospect.</p>
   <p>The AHC (as I suppose we shall have to
call it) now has a formal constitution and its own magazine. The
enthusiasm generated at last year's conference continues to
thrive. But I hope that next year, when it is planned to organise a
smaller national conference on more focussed topics, I shall be able
to report more substantial fruits from it.</p>
