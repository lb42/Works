   <head type="event">IUSC Workshop ON 3-4
Jan 1984</head>
   <p>Over 132 people attended this workshop on
knowledge-based or expert systems, although no-one I spoke to appeared
to have any very clear idea of quite what such systems were or might
be used for Their chief components appear to be firstly a
knowledge-base, which is not quite the same as a database because the
entities represented in it include both vague or imprecise quantities
and equally vague rules about their significance, secondly an
inference engine, which is a processor capable of both using and
adding to the knowledge base, and finally a fairly sophisticated
man-machine interface, usually in natural language albeit within a
fairly restricted semantic domain Such systems are VERY EXPENSIVE
INDEED to construct, and thus are to be found only amongst the VERY
RICH, e.g the oil industry, the US Dept of Defense and any UK Computer
Science Dept which has got its hands on some Alvey funding.</p>
   <p>The
first speaker, from RACAL, appeared to be rather unnerved by the size
of his audience and was also clearly under instructions not to reveal
too much about his subject, a system for making sense of the vast
amounts of data obtained during exploratory drillings in the North
SeaSince exploitation of any resulting oil wells is usually a
co-operative venture in which the cut each member of the consortium
receives depends crucially on the size of reserves found at a
particular place, it is rather crucial to get unbiassed and accurate
information A 5% error could mean a difference of £350 millions The
system was computationally unfashionable, being model based rather
than rule based; that is, it works by constantly revising and
improving on rules of thumb derived from observations rather than a
priori knowledge There is no attempt to model causality in its
knowledge-base which means among other things that the system has no
way of reconciling contradictory conclusions reached from different
premises It runs on a special purpose AI machine (the Symbolics LISP
machine) which also supported numerical analysis in Fortran and a
conventional database management system (unspecified).</p>
   <p>This
presentation, (which should have been more impressive given that it
proved to be the only one describing a real fully functional system)
was followed by two sales pitches, one for SAGE, an expert systems
shell marketed by SPL, and</p>
   <p>the other for REVEAL, a decision
support system marketed by TYMSHARE Both are also available from ICL
and cost an arm and a leg, except that there is a version of SAGE for
VAX VMS currently on offer with a massive educational
discount.</p>
   <p>The SAGE knowledge base is created by the user as a
set of rules and objects which the inference engine then uses to
establish a goal (e.g "This user is liable to have a heart attack") by
means of a dialogue and backward-chaining reasoning (i.e People under
stress are more likely to have heart attacks, so I must establish how
likely this user is to be under stress; to establish which I need to
establish how many Advisory Sessions he has done in the last month; to
establish which.etc It's called recursion!)Because objects can have a
truth value (probably false, nearly true, etc.) rules involving
combinations of such objects are said to exhibit fuzzy logic; thus,
for SAGE, if p is 0.3 true, and q is 0.8 true, then p AND q is 0.3
true, and p OR q is 0.8 true Various smart alecks in the audience
pointed out that this was a barely adequate fuzzy logic, with which
the speaker had the good sense to agreeNevertheless, I think SAGE
would be a good way to learn about expert systems and might even be
useful for somethingREVEAL by contrast proved to be a souped-up
financial modelling system with little to recommend it apart from the
use of fuzzy logic in both its database system and its English
language interface, so that the modeller can say things like "List all
tall rich blondes with large bosoms' without having to specify what
'tall', 'rich' and 'large' mean exactly.</p>
   <p>The conference dinner
was satisfactorily sybaritic and was followed by the traditional
drunken gossip in the bar, during which several people lurched up to
me and said "Famulus?" in a menacing sort of way.</p>
   <p>The following
morning began with a presentation on Salford's new Prolog system
(which was also available for hands-on use during the morning) This is
(like Poplog) a hybrid in which all those bits that are difficult or
impossible to do in pure Prolog (like reading from files or doing
assignments) are hived off to another language, in this case LISP It
also supports a better syntax for grammar rules, a Fortran interface
and -yes- floating point arithmetic! But it is only available on Prime
and is still under development.</p>
   <p>The trouble with Prolog of
course, the next speaker pointed out, is that it is really only
practicable on machines that don't exist and are unlikely to for the
next ten yearsSomething called "a given sector of my client base" was
however attuned to it and so his company (Cambridge Consultants Ltd)
were investigating its usefulness in</p>
   <p>real time (but not as yet
real) applications Their investigations had however thrown up nothing
that could be communicated to us other than a list of the available
versions of the language and some fairly superficial remarks about
it.</p>
   <p>John Baldwin from Bristol and Ron Knott from Surrey
re-established the intellectual credibility of this workshop by the
next two papers which described programming languages capable of
building knowledge based systems Baldwin described his Fuzzy
Relational Inference Language, which is a logic programming language
incorporating uncertainty in a far more thorough and mathematically
respectable way than SAGE Other buzzwords included the blackboard
model, parallel architecture, a self organising knowledge base and a
dataflow machine His paper was the only one that could properly be
said to manifest state of the art knowledge, although Knott gave an
interesting survey of the available functional programming languages,
typified by LISP, variations of which are very much still alive and
kicking.</p>
   <p>After lunch, delegates were restored to good humour by
Tim O'Shea (OU) who gave a good survey of Al-supported computer aided
learning systems Apparently the crucial question to ask someone trying
to sell you a computer tutor is "What sort of task difficulty model do
you have?” and, if this fails to floor him (or it), 'Does it support
dynamic student modelling?' The speaker was good enough to kindle
enthusiasm for his subject which is saying a good deal in this case
Apparently the process of producing CAL systems is generally known as
"authoring" The people (or things) that do it are presumably known as
"authorers".</p>
   <p>Finally we were given an interesting account of the
current structure of the Alvey directorate, and even some figures
about how its huge funds were being split up Whether or not these
large sums will succeed in reversing the process of rot supposedly
created by that convenient scapegoat the Lighthill Report, or whether
they will simply prove a useful way of cutting down funding for other
academic research remains to be seen, though the fact that ALVEY
expands to "All Large Ventures Except Yours” may be taken as some
indication.</p>
