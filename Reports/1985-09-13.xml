the Theatre</head>
   <p>This one and a half day conferencette had been
ingeniously timed to squeeze into a weekend separating the annual
gatherings of two ot the three major international bodies to do with
theatre research, namely SIBMAS (Societe Internationale des
bibliotheques et Musees des arts du Spectacle); which was last week,
and FIRI (Federation Internationale de recherches Theatrals) , which
is next week. Consequently it attracted a rather more distinguished
and cosmopolitan patronage than its subject matter miqht have lead one
to expect. There were about a hundred delegates, mostly British or
American, though with a sizeable number of German, French, and
Scandinavians as well. More exotic presences included a lady from the
Australian Arts Council, a Pole and a genuine Russian from
Moscow. Most of those present appeared to be fairly senior staff from
theatre museums, libraries or archives, having only a smattering of
knowledge about computing, with a few notable
exceptions.</p>
   <p>Proceedings were held at Gresham College, which
seems to be the nom de guerre of City University's Dept. of Arts
Policy, this institution (almost literally) hangs out on the 12th
floor of Frobisher Crescent, in the Barbican. 1 have never seen this
monument to the power of money before, and was therefore quite
impressed (if perplexed) by it.</p>
   <p>The first day began after lunch
with three demonstrations, the first, live from Munich, was of TANDEM,
the current market leader in theatre databases. This is an EEC funded
project, currently indexing all dramatic works performed in Germany
since 1960, some 13,000 documents, as well as bibliographic data, this
holds information about productions (the roles, performers, costume
designs, instruments used, stage sets etc.). It uses STAIRS, and runs
on an IBM 370 belonginq to the German Ministry of Agriculture. The
demonstration was moderately impressive, if you've never seen a
demonstration of STAIRS before. The second demonstration was live from
City University New York, where a very similar U.S. project is going
on, using this time SPIRES. The demonstration was dauntingly tutorial
in nature, and again, impressive only if you've never seen an
information retrieval system, circa 1965, in action. The database was
about 6 Mb, of which rather more than half is taken up by index
file. The third demonstration was live from the Barbican Booking
Office and consisted of (a) a nice straightforward ticket-manaqement
package for computerised box offices (it's called BOCS and runs on a
PDP-11) and (b) a rather natty booking system for use by both
theatrical agents in search of gigs and theatre managers in search of
acts, which runs on Prestel.</p>
   <p>Suitably refreshed by this brush
with reality, we then went back up in the lift to Gresham College for
a swift Reception (wine, olives, peanuts). This proved to be
remarkably convivial considering I hadn't met any of the people
present before (except for Joe Donohue who claimed to remember me from
Dartmouth nine years ago and stole one of my jokes for his speech the
<pb facs="https://github.com/lb42/Works/tree/master/Reports/Pages/img487.jpg"/>
next day); perhaps theatre
historians are friendlier than database specialists.</p>
   <p>The second
day consisted of three sessions, one on "International"
(i.e. non-British) theatrical databases, one on the home-grown
variety, and the third on whether the twain could ever
meet.</p>
   <p>Session one was inaugurated by a panel of distinquished
Presidents and such like, making some fairly anodyne remarks about the
virtues of international co-operation. Ian Herbert, orqaniser of the
conference, also spoke, bringing to our attention the production of
Cyrano de Berqerac to be screened by C4TV tomorrow, (though quite why
I know not) and explaining that the purpose of theatrical databases
was to pass on to future generations the theatrical
experience.</p>
   <p>Speakers were limited to ten minutes each: a good
idea. Joe Donohue gave yet another update on the state of the London
Stage Databank at the University of Massachaussets. This, currently
using INFOL2 on the CDC Cyber, is now being moved to a Corona (IBM PC
clone), attached to something called an Omega Bernouli Box -a sort of
20 Mb jukebox of floppies- and running Revelation. Donohue confidently
averred that this would be compatible with everything else because it
used ASCII. Susan Madrell from the Sydney based Arts Documentation
Service of the Australia Council described a large collection of
Australian press cuttings (about 57 k clippings) covering anything
vaguely artistic and Australian since 1966. This is indexed by proper
name, and a subject index is to be added from next year. They too have
a PC, and use Wordstar and dBase II. It is planned to "download" the
data to something called Ozzynet (spelling?). Didier Augustin from
Metz described through an interpreter the Mirabel System, an online
database of available play scripts, accessible via Transpac, the
French answer to Prestel. Any French language play script (almost) can
be archived at Metz, and its details (cast, plot, resources,
category...) entered in the database. Of about 2500 plays currently
held, 84% are unpublished. Augustin was very alarmist about becoming
over-reliant on i.t.; perhaps the recent temporary collapse of
Transpac due to overloading was at the back of his mind.</p>
   <p>After
coffee, the two major existing databases which had been demonstrated
on the previous day got further exposure. Irving Brown (City
University of New York) provided some background to the Theatre
Research Data Center (TRDC) and its newly-published International
Bibliography of the Theatre (IBT). TRDC had painstakingly established
a taxonomy of theatrical terms and designed a Data Entry Sheet; data
capture was by a team of about sixty voluntary unpaid field
bibliographers or by co-operation with "other international projects"
(i.e. TANDEM). IBT is computer typeset directly from the database,
(but not as nicely as the Greek Lexicon), will appear annually and
contains what its promoters clearly regard as a mind-boggling 1300
entries this year. Heinrich Huesmann (Munich) gave some more
information about the political structure of TANDEM: it is EEC funded
and is looking for national bodies with which to co-operate,
co-operation consisting of the national body depositing its records
with TANDEM and in return getting the right to use the database, this
idea is clearly far too Teutonic and sensible over to work.</p>

   <p>Over lunch I was button holed by an
egg-shaped bookseller who had been sold a Gould running Oracle and was
wondering what to do with it; this went on so lonq that I barely had
time to qet my overheads in order before the afternoon session
began. A succession of lady librarians described their varyingly
interestinq cataloguing systems. Sarah Woodcock (Theatre Museum,
London) was using, or planning to use, TANDEM for their very
miscellaneous collection; she also used the Museum Documentation
Association's forms, the Betjemanesque Jane Hatford Dunn (British
Theatre Association) was also in transition to TANDEM. They have vast
numbers of sets of plays for loan indexed to varyingly successful
degree. I gave my standard soft sell for the Shakespeare database at
top speed, which appeared to provoke stunned amazement. Judith Chapman
(Resource Dance Centre at Surrey) uses INFO on the Surrey Prime to
index bibliographies of dance material. Gillian Hartnoll (British Film
Institute) outlined plans to integrate several existing databases (the
British National Film and Video Catalogue, the index to Sight and
Sound, the Monthly Film Bulletin etc.) using Oracle on a cluster of
four micro-VAXes. This sounded v. impressive.</p>
   <p>The final session
on integration, standards, how and why was a general free for all
which had the occasional high spot, notably a statement from the
editor of a Russian theatre magazine requesting articles on
computerisation and a few terse comments from Professor Carlos
Tindemans, vice president of the International Association of Theatre
Critics who, introduced as a leading theatre semiologist, stated that
he was in fact a semiotician and then sat down. Ian Herbert proposed a
form of words giving himself a mandate to investigate the feasibility
ot setting up a British Theatre Database which was passed on the nod
and the proceedings broke up in good humour.</p>
