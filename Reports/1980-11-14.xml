L. Burnard</head>
   <head type="location">RNIB, London</head>
   <head type="when">November 14 1980</head>
   <p>I visited the RNIB Computing
centre in London at the invitation of their chief systems analyst to
discuss the possibility of co-operating in exchanges of
machine-readable text. The RNIB now produce all new Braille titles on
their GEC-based computer system. About half a dozen people are
employed typing into terminals in the normal way, but they have also
been using a KDEM (indistinguishable from ours) for the last six
months. One copy of the text is pre-edited (i.e. marked up for
homonyms, paragraph markers etc.), while another is scanned by the
KDEM. Quite a lot of pre-editing is done directly on the KDEM as the
text is scanned. The resulting text is then processed by a program
developed at Warwick called DOTSYS. This outputs the text in a format
which can be displayed as braille on a specially built terminal for
further editing and is ultimately used to produce the zinc plates from
which braille books are still embossed. The KDEM, I was told, worked
far too fast for the DOTSYS processor to keep up, though it greeted my
arrival by going into 'Panic' mode amidst familiar cries of "Where's
Paul?‚Äù; judging by the amount of error correction going on on the
braille terminal DOTSYS has shortcomings additional to its
slowness. Of course the KDEM is only used on modern printed English
texts (mostly pulp romances etc.).</p>
   <p>We discussed copyright
problems and agreed to exchange lists and other information;
particular interest was expressed in database systems - they were
considering Rapport - and in the possibility of using publisher's
tapes as the basis of a new Braille dictionary.</p>
