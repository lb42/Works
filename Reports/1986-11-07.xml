   <head type="event">Conference on New Oxford English Dictionary</head>
   <head type="date"> November 7-13 1986</head>


   <p>Hearing that I was hoping to attend the second University of Waterloo
conference on the new OED, Ian Lancashire, driving force behind Toronto
University's thriving Centre for Computing in the Humanitives (CCH),
kindly invited me to give a seminar there. This being too good an
opportunity to miss, as there are several projects at Toronto of
considerable interest, I arrived in Toronto (on a special -bilingual-
cheap flight via Montreal) a few days before the OED Conference proper
and visited...
</p>
   <p>
 The Dictionary of Old English which flourishes in several rooms on the
14th floor of the magnificent Robarts Library, where I saw some very
flashy Xerox workstations given to the project together with a small VAX
configuration. The project has a single programmer who has to develop all
the software for editing and page make-up of the dictionary entries,
which have now reached the letter D. They were astonished to hear that we
could offer online searching of substantial portions of the corpus, even
if we could not display Old English letters. Their interface is
pleasantly similar to the desk-tops on which the terminals sit, (i.e.
cluttered) and just to be on the safe side the project also maintains (in
several hundred drinking chocolate cartons) numerous bits of paper
derived from the corpus we know and love. Ashley Amos, sole surviving
editor of the dictionary, managed to track down some obscure charters
which a user here had been unable to find in our copy and was generally
encouraging. 
</p>
   <p>

 At University of Toronto Computing Services (UTCS), I inspected the
bookshop (which is splendid) and the computer shop (likewise; hottest new
property reportedly the Amiga 1040 which is selling like hot cakes, or
muffins as the Canadians unaccountably call them). I was not shown their
Cray, nor indeed their IBM 4361, but instead was introduced by John
Bradley, apparently the resident humanities computing boffin, to TACT - a
new interactive text-searching system he is developing to run on
Toronto's ubiquitous (see below) IBM-XTs - and by Lidio Presutti (his
sidekick) to MTAS, an OCP look-alike of which I was given a copy, also
for use on IBM-XTs. Time did not permit me to discover much about the way
the centre is organised, other than the fact that they have recently
started charging their users real money (well, dollars and cents anyway)
for computing resources consumed, with predictably dire consequences for
anyone not funded by the Defence Dept or similar. 
</p>
   <p>

  Nevertheless, Humanities Computing is set to thrive at Toronto, largely
as a result of Ian Lancashire's "partnership" with IBM-Canada. This
involves the setting up of four rooms full of XTs and staff to support
them over three years, all paid for by Big Blue, which gets no more in
return than lots of academic credibility and three years worth of
humanities graduates convinced that all computers should run PC-DOS. Any
software etc. developed will be placed in the public domain.  One of the
four centres was on the verge of opening its doors: it had 24 XTs on a
token ring with an AT as file server and three printers. The XTs were set
up in such a way that they could only be booted from a supplied disk,
which could not be removed from drive A. They were also bolted to the
floor, despite Canadians' proverbial honesty. Students will use these to
prepare machine-readable texts, using EDLIN or NotaBene (WordPerfect is
not regarded as highly as it is here), to be processed using MTAS and
maybe TACT. Other software to be made available includes the Duke Toolkit
and the usual clutch of concordance packages, Kermit, network mail etc.
as well as some public domain text-jiggling utilities designed to whet if
not satisfy the literary appetite. Students will apparently be expected
to become reasonably proficient in not just PC-DOS but also VM-CMS and
UNIX as well, which seems a bit steep. Conspicuously absent was any
whisper of what databases are for. There is rumoured to be a Masscomp
somewhere in the English Dept but I never saw it. 
</p>
   <p>

 I gave my seminar in the Centre for Mediaeval Studies (where the second
of the four IBM rooms was still under construction); I had been billed to
talk about the KDEM but instead waxed lyrical on the necessity for the
Text Archive, the problems of representing and processing text properly
and the wonders of CAFS to a gratifyingly large (c. 36, including the
Director of UTCS, I later learned) audience, most of which survived till
the end. 
</p>
   <p>

The next day, being Saturday, I spent at Niagara Falls, of which the
Canadian end is unquestionably the better, and truly spectacular. I was
startled by a bright red London bus (used for touristic purposes) and
resisted the temptation to have my photo taken going over in a barrel,
though I did go into the tunnels behind the Falls which command a
magnificent view of their derriere. 
</p>
   <p>

Back in Toronto, I lunched with Michael Gervers, who runs the Documents
of Essex England Data Set (DEEDS) project, more or less on his own with
some Government assistance in the form of temporary (YOP-type) staff. The
project involves the indexing of a massive collection of mediaeval
records from Essex (England) and is the only real database project I came
across at the University. It started off using an awful DBMS package
which sounds like a Canadian version of IMS, but is now going through the
traumas of conversion to Oracle, at present on a huge AT (with a 40 Mb
disc AND a Bernoulli box), though it will be moving to the UTCS IBM
system shortly. The cost of Oracle for this system appears to have been
met from the IBM 'partnership', although what other users it will have in
the absence of any local knowledge of how to exploit or support it is
less clear.
</p>
   <p>

I travelled to Kitchener, the nearest large town to the University of
Waterloo, by train in the company of Willard McCarty who works with Ian
Lancashire in running the CCH, and Abigail Young, who works on the
Records of Early English Drama (REED) project also at Toronto. She had
been largely instrumental in depositing in the Text Archive that
proportion of the published corpus of REED texts which was still
available on floppy disk, so I was very pleased to meet her. 

</p>
   <p>

And so to Advances in Lexicology (not a word to be found in OED -yet)
which was the second annual conference held at Waterloo's Centre for the
New Oxford English Dictionary and was generally felt to be a distinct
improvement on its predecessor. Twelve papers were given over three days
to about 150 delegates, roughly equally divided in their alleigances
between lexicography, computer science and artificial intelligence. One
reception, many coffee breaks and two fairly spartan lunches were laid
on, during all of which there was much animated discussion.  The best
joke of the conference was probably Dana Scott's collection of howlers,
of which I recall only "AI is when the farmer does it to the cow instead
of the bull" which manages to combine innuendo with syntactic ambiguity. 
 
</p>
   <p>
Howard Webber (Houghton Mifflin) 's keynote address was the only one of
the papers not (yet) available in printed form; like many keynote
addresses it sounded rather as if he had made it up on the plane from
several old after dinner speeches. However, it got out of the way all
that necessary stuff about the role of dictionaries as a sort of
"Language Command Central" (his phrase), the unease with which
lexicographers had regarded the machine, the difference between machine-
readable dictionaries and lexical databases and the transition from the
former to the latter, while also dropping a few hints about where the
'American Heritage' dictionary project was now going in its co-operation
with Brown University (nowhere in particular, as far as I could tell,
other than the preparation of a new 50 million word corpus).

</p>
   <p>
Manfred Gehrke (Siemens AG) tackled head-on the computational
difficulties of providing rapid access to a realistically large lexicon.
The method described, using morphemes rather than 'words' as primary keys
has several attractive features (like the comparatively smaller number -
and size - of such keys), though is perhaps more appropriate to highly
agglutinative languages such as German. The fact that morphemes have
meanings which the compounds derived from them usually employ is also of
particular importance in German. Even so segmentation can cause problems:
"Madchen handelsschule" is a girls business college, but "Madchenhandels
schule" is a white slavery school. 

</p>
   <p>
Mark Aronoff (SUNY) and Roy Byrd (IBM) gave a rather dubious account of
the role of etymology and word length in English word formation. A
dictionary of high frequency affix lists was extracted from the top end
of the Kucera-Francis word list, and another unspecified 3/4 million word
list. This was then enhanced with some fairly simple etymological
information from Webster's 7th (i.e. did the affix enter the language
from a Germanic language or a Romance one). Any complications (such as
words which were imported into English from French, but came into French
from Germanic) were rigorously disregarded, as was the distinction
between words which were formed within the English language and those
which were borrowed -as it were- fully formed. Much statistical jiggery-
pokery was then employed to determine how syllable-length and etymology
accounted for the productivity of various affixes, and much wonder
expressed at the apparent ease with which native speakers keep their
neologisms racially pure. But the results, as Mike Lesk pointed out,
would have been equally consistent with a simple phonemic explanation:
(predominantly longer) Latinate suffixes naturally sound better on
(generally Latinate) polysyllabic verbalisations, while (often short)
German endings go best with (mostly Saxon) little words.
   
</p>
   <p>
Walter and Sally Sedelow (Univ of Arkansas) have been in the field of
computational linguistics almost since it began; their paper, which was
mostly given by Walter, thus had a tendency to historical reminscence not
quite germane to the issue, while employing terminology and a style, the
clauses of which were embedded well beyond the capacity of most
intelligences not endowed with a 640 Mb hardware stack, not unlike some
really nasty exercises in automatic parsing, and consequently seemed to
go on for a great deal of time without ever getting very far. This was a
pity, because its subject (the adequacy and usability of Roget's
Thesaurus as a knowledge representation language) is important and
interesting. A mathematical model of the thesaurus (derived from work by
Robert Bryan at San Francisco State) was presented and various other
research reports adduced in support of the claim that the associations
represented in Roget are actually significant. The skeptical might say
that this was rather unsurprising; however anyone who can (apparently in
all seriousness) express the concept in the following way (quoted from
the abstract) clearly cannot be ignored, if only on stylistic grounds:

</p>
   <p>
"The paper ends...with a statement to the effect that any assertions
that the Thesaurus is a poor representation of Emnglish semantic
organization would be ill founded and, given depth of analysis, would
have to be regarded as counterfactual"

</p>
   <p>
Judy Kegl (Princeton), Beth Levin (MIT) and Sue Atkins (Collins) gave
probably the meatiest of the papers at the conference, - and
coincidentally no doubt the only one co-written by a real lexicographer
(Atkins). It includes much analysis of the different ways in which two
language learners dictionaries (LDOCE and OALDCE) attempt to convey the
intimate relationship between the various senses of English verbs and
their complement-taking properties, (or case structure). Even such
apparently obvious characteristics of the verb as transitivity are not
always predictable by simple transformational rules such a "If the verb
takes an object then it can be used passively" (e.g. "The shoes fit",
"The shoes fit me" but not "I am fitted by the shoes"), but there is no
self-evident place to put such facts about the verb "fit" in a
dictionary. Consequently dictionaries differ: "cost" for example is
intransitive according to OALDCE, and transitive according to LDOCE.  The
paper also contains much that is refreshingly sensible about the nature
of specialised dictionaries (such as learners' dictionaries) and the
distinction between them and the sort of immensely complex linguistic
snapshot to which some computational linguists expect all lexicons to
aspire. The sort of knowledge needed for the latter, though indispensable
to the former, must be processed and combined a way appropriate to
particular users. Detailed assessment of the way certain notoriously
difficult verbs are presented in OALDCE and LDOCE is used to present
inconsistencies inherent in the absence of any generally agreed meta-
language for verbal descriptions, a point which recurred in other papers.
The strength of this paper is the combination of the structuring
capabilities offered by theoretical linguistics with the reductive
classificatory skills of lexicography, which it both demonstrates and
advocates.

Thomas Ahlswede (Illinois Inst Tech) reported on the continuing saga of
the parsing of Websters 7th, first initiated by John Olney et al in 1968.
'Parsing' here means the recognition and extraction of semantic
information from the text of a dictionary definition which can then be
stored and manipulated within a lexical database. It is analagous to (but
even more ambitious than) attempts to extract similar semantic structures
from free text. Dictionary definitions provide implicit information about
relationships between words, not just taxonomic (an x is a sort of y) but
also part/whole relationships. But a simple syntactic analysis of the
text of a definition is rarely adequate to the task of understanding it;
a detailed lexicon containing information about each word likely to be
encountered by the parser is evidently necessary. For Websters 7th, some
of this information (but not all) can be extracted from the entries
themselves, while some of it is already available in the existing
parser's lexicon of about 10,000 entries. This process was later dubbed
"dictionary hermeneutics" by Graeme Hirst. How much easier it might have
been if the dictionary structure had been initially captured in a
meaningful way (as was the OED) is an embarassing question which no-one
had the poor taste to ask.</p>
   <p>
Nicoletta Calzolari (Pisa) described an equally ambitious but rather more
practical project now under way under Zampolli's charismatic aegis: the
construction of a bilingual lexical database (LDB) system by linking
together existing monolingual LDBs, the linkage being provided by machine
readable bilingual dictionaries. Combining monolingual and bilingual
dictionaries, which typically differ in the degree of discrimination felt
necessary for individual word senses, should lead to a much richer
integrated system. The dictionaries to be used include Zingarelli,
Garzanti, Collins Italian/English, LDOCE and OALDCE. No complex supra-
linguistic model is envisaged, simply the ability to discriminate senses
when going in either direction between two languages. Such old chestnuts
as the fact that Eskimos have 99 different words for 'snow' and Arabs
none at all were not on the agenda: the project is not really concerned
with semantics, but aims rather to provide a useful tool for translators
and others using existing dictionaries. 
</p>
   <p>
The final session of the second day comprised summaries of the current
state of play of the NOED Project itself, as viewed by firstly Tim Benbow
and John Simpson (OUP) and secondly Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet
(Waterloo), all of whom were sporting Oxford Dictionary Ties to mark the
occasion. Benbow reported  that the dictionary's 21,000 pages had now
been rendered machine readable, using an estimated 500 million
keystrokes, with an error rate of around 4 in 10,000; this was being
proof read and corrected by ICC to bring the residual error rate down to
less than 1 in 250,000 characters. The data is held at Oxford and
manipulated in a SQL database under VM/CMS. Rick Kazman's parser would be
used to convert the ICC mark-up to SGML, and other software developed in
house mostly by IBM secondees (e.g. a text editor called LEXX) will be
used by the lexicographers to complete the integration of the dictionary
and the supplements. Some wholesale changes will be made (notably
Murray's method of representing pronunciation will be replaced by IPA) at
the same time as automatic integration is carried out; some (about 4000)
new words/senses will also be added to bring the early parts of the
supplement up to date (This is the responsibility of John Simpson's NEWS
project).  Publication of the new integrated dictionary (the Book) is
planned for spring 1989. It will have 22 volumes and cost about £1500. 
Publication of a CD-ROM version of the OED alone (without supplements) is
also planned, probably for late 1987, mainly as a means of testing the
market for electronic forms of the dictionary, and providing information
for the database design work going on at Waterloo. It is hoped to set up
a unit of lexicographers in Washington which, together with the NEWS
team, will ensure that the dictionary, or rather its eventual electronic
form, will be kept up to date on both sides of the Atlantic.

</p>
   <p>
At Waterloo several very interesting pieces of software have been
developed, which were described by Gaston Gonnet and Frank Tompa. While
waiting for the ICC data to reach them, they had been experimenting with
a smaller dictionary of Trinidadian English which had successfully
demonstrated the generality of their approach. The software used
comprises (1) INR/lsim - a parser-generator and parser for context free
grammars (2) PAT - a fast string searcher and (3) GOEDEL the "Glamorous
OED Enquiry Language". INR/lsim (no-one seems to know what this is short
for) resembles in philosophy the parser-generator developed for Project
TOSCA at Nijmegen, though I never got the opportunity to ask Tompa
whether he'd heard of this. Maybe it's just the only way of solving the
problem properly. It has been used by Kazman among others to convert the
ICC mark-up to SGML, and to convert the OALDCE tape as first supplied to
the Text Archive into a similar SGML markup. PAT (written by Gonnet who
has made quite a study of text searching algorithms, I discovered) stores
indexes to a text in a Patricia tree, a form of condensed binary tree new
to me, though apparently to be found in Knuth if you know where to look.
PAT is very fast but, at present, very simple minded. GOEDEL is a more
sophisticated system, still under development, the most crucial element
of which is not so much its current Algol-like syntax as the fact that
its basic datatype is a parse tree (again like the Dutch system). This
solves all manner of nasty data management problems and bridges the gap
between DBMS and Text Processing systems in a way at least as natty as
CAFS and probably more so. The user specifies a parse tree for the text
to be returned and can impose selectional restraints using SQL like
conditions.

</p>
   <p>
Peter Davies (described as an 'Independent Lexicographer') read out his
paper from the conference proceedings in a dry monotone well suited to
its contents, which contained rather few conclusions derived from some
fairly specious data. He had tagged the most frequent word forms in the
American Heritage Corpus with the century of their introduction to
English and the language from which they derived. (Like Aronoff and Byrd
he was uninterested in the fact that this corpus neither distinguishes
homographs nor associate inflections of the same lemma.) The results
presented were raw percentages  ("In the top 500 types, 75% are native")
with no attempt to adjust for the known skewness of vocabulary
distribution irrespective of origin. 

</p>
   <p>
Alexander Nakhimovsky (Colgate) is much obsessed with time, more
specifically with how language reflects "common-sense reasoning" about
the nature of time. He is one of the "Meaning-Text" school of Soviet
theoretical linguists. To understand why to answer "I have a 12.30 class"
constitutes refusal of a lunch invitation requires not just knowledge of
social convention, but also of the probable durations of lunches and
classes. English verbs are not marked for perfect as opposed to imperfect
so that "Alice read her book quickly" could have two quite different
meanings (either as a process or as an event). Knowledge of the duration
of events is a linguistic phenomenon because many words cannot be
understood without knowing the duration typically associated with them -
not just obvious words like 'lunch' or 'nap', but also 'holiday' (which
cannot be in minutes but is usually not in years) or 'insomnia'(which
cannot be measured in minutes nor go on in the afternoon). It is apparent
that the units of time appropriate to common sense reasoning vary with
the duration of the event, as does their precision. (Thus '5 minutes'
means somewhere between 1 and 10, but '3 minutes' usually means just
that). To make up for the absence of a perfective/imperfective aspectual
difference, English relies on an opposition Nakhimovsky calls
telic/atelic, which has to do with the narrative within which the verb
appears, so far as I understand (or have understood) it. 

</p>
   <p>
Fabrizio Sebastiani (Pisa) presented a more conventional view of the role
of the lexicon in describing QWERTY, a knowledge-based system designed to
'understand' technical writing. It operates by converting parse trees
representing syntactic structures onto semantic structures represented in
the knowledge representation language KL-MAGMA. The fact that technical
writing is mostly composed of 'paradigmatic' sentences, from which such
nasty problems as mood, aspect and temporal position are conspicuously
absent was touched but not insisted upon: unfortunately Sebastiani did
not allow himself enough time to make clear exactly what was original in
the system nor how effective the design was in practise.

</p>
   <p>
Graeme Hirst (Toronto) closed the conference on a controversial note
which also managed to bring together the two sides of lexicology, if only
in debate. His paper stated with agreeably frank partisanship why
dictionaries should list case structure, that is, specifications of the
valid roles associated with any particular verb, together with any
semantic restrictions on the values that may fill those roles and any
preposition or other syntactic marker specific to them. Case structures
may be found in one guise or another in almost every theory of language
or cognition, from Chomsky to Charniak, and in a weak form are almost
present already in the 'verb-patterns' specified in some language
learning dictionaries. Hirst's most telling argument in favour of his
proposal was that if lexicographers did not supply such information then
computational linguists would, and would certainly do a worse job of it.
The most telling counter argument was that, at present, no-one has a
clear idea of exactly what cases (roles) exist nor is there any agreement
on how to define them. A less telling counter-argument, which to my mind
unnecessarily dominated the subsequent heated discussion, was the
economics of adding this information to the already overcrowded pages of
a dictionary; when pressed, Hirst said that he thought it would be more
use to more dictionary users than etymology if something had to be
sacrificed. 

</p>
   <p>
After the conference proper, I visited the NOED Centre itself, where I
met Donna Lee Berg, the librarian on the project, and acquired offprints
of some technical reports on the software being developed there by
Gonnet. I also watched some confused lexicographers struggling with
GOEDEL and, while being very impressed by the power of this system, was
glad to notice that there are 18 months labelled "development of user
interface" set aside in the planning of the project which have not yet
begun. 

</p>
   <p>
Back in Toronto, I found Ian Lancashire very busy preparing a long term
plan for funding humanities computing beyond the end of his IBM
partnership. This entails the preparation of a detailed report of all the
activity currently going on at the six or seven universities in Ontario
which is to be presented to the Ontario government with a request for
funding very shortly. I managed to distract him sufficiently to discuss
briefly his slightly different views of the functions of a text archive.
He wishes to see texts distributed as freely as public domain software,
the role of the Archive being simply one from which an original non-
corrupted version can always be retrieved, and the only restriction on
the user being simply not to redistribute materials for profit. To that
end, all texts encoded at Toronto (and there will be many, since
preparation of a specified text forms a part of students course work)
will be prepared to a common standard from non-copyright texts, such as
facsimiles of early printed books. Whether this is practical in our case,
where many of our texts are prepared from modern editions or texts
otherwise still in copyright, is unclear. It is certainly something we
should consider when capturing texts in the future however. I would also
like to give some thought to the possibility of making some of our other
texts more freely available (i.e. copyable).
