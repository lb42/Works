   <p>It's somewhat of a cliché to describe
<ref target="http://www.uml.lodz.pl/indexe.html">Lódz </ref>(pronounced,
approximately, <hi>Wootch</hi>)  as the Manchester of Poland: this
doesn't mean so much that it is blessed by an excellent football team,
as that it is cursed with a major industrial past. At the turn of the
century, it was a rich city, built on cloth, and with one of the most
prosperous middle class communities east of Berlin. The centre of the
town, and the University quarter, still boasts a number of the fine
houses they built, some of them now being carefully restored; others
still hidden beneath the grey dust and neglect that seems to live over
the whole of this region of Europe. But then, of course, came the
thirties, and the appropriation of Poland by invaders, first from the
West, and then from the East.  Lódz, I learned from my Guidebook,
has the dubious honour of having been the first city in modern times to
establish a ghetto and
<ref target="http://www.virtualfilm.com/html/Screening/Documentary/Lodz_Ghetto/lodz_index.html">the
ghost of that absence</ref> still haunts the place.  Curiously, for there
are now no Jews to be seen here, it's the star of David which is now
daubed on walls, in contexts where elsewhere one might find the swastika
daubed, in association with the swirling iconography of urban rage
imitated from the inner cities of further west.  </p>
   <p>The teaching of English is a major growth area in Polish
universities; for every student learning Russian or  German, there are
ten wishing to learn the language of McDonalds and Marks and Spencer,
whose emblems  now dominate the centre of Warsaw as well as that of High
Wycombe. <ref target="http://www.britcoun.org/poland/poleven.htm"> The
British Council </ref>appears to be playing a major role in satisfying
this demand,  as witness its funding of this conference, and a number of
other educational programmes aimed at secondary and tertiary English
language teaching. An unusual and interesting aspect of these programmes
is the recognition that access to (and study of) language corpora are of
particular importance if there is to be a systematic improvement in the
quality of English spoken (and taught) by Poles. Hence the organization
of this well-attended international conference. </p>
   <p>The <ref target="http://www.uni.lodz.pl/iangl/palc.htm">four day event
</ref> was hosted jointly by the British Council and the
<ref target="http://www.uni.lodz.pl/iangl/engphil.htm">University of Lódz
Institute of English Studies</ref>, represented respectively by Susan
Maingay and Barbara Lewandowska, with assistance from James Melia, and
took place in the University's recently constructed and  comfortable
conference centre. Each day began with a brisk walk to the University's
council chamber for a plenary session,  held beneath the stern depicted
gaze of assorted  dignatories in funny hats, followed by parallel
sessions at the conference centre, combining project reports and
research papers from a wide spread of corpus applications and interests.
 Evenings were given over to relaxation, discussion, and the opportunity
to sample some excellent Polish hospitality.</p>

   <p>
      <label>Plenary sessions</label>
   </p>
   <p>The conference began on a high note, with an excellent lecture by
Professor <hi>Michael Hoey</hi> (<ref target="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~tony1/aelsu.html">Liverpool</ref>) on the
nature of the corpus linguistics enterprise, the questions it asked, and
 the answers it might provide. Asserting that corpora could be used to
provide evidence of lexical patterns, of semantic prosodies, of
syntactic patterns, of colligation, and  even of text grammars, Hoey
proceeded to discuss striking examples from each of these categories, of
which I will summmarize here only  what he called "the drinking problem
principle". If someone has difficulty in drinking, it will generally not
be referred to as a <hi>drinking problem</hi>  because the more common
collocational sense is inappropriate. In the same way, corpus evidence,
rather surprisingly, demonstrates that following a posessive adjective
(my, our, his etc) the plural form <hi>reasons</hi> is always preferred
to the singular <hi>reason</hi> when the intended sense is "cause" (our
reasons for doing this...) rather than "rationality"  (to lose one's
reason).  </p>
   <p>The second plenary speaker was <hi>
         <ref target="http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/staff/tony/tony.htm"> Tony McEnery</ref>
      </hi>
(Lancaster Univ) introducing the notion of what he called multimedia
corpora. He stressed the  need to introduce visual information as a
context for understanding verbal material, and showed us a few pages
from the corpus of children's writing and drawings currently being
created at Lancaster, which will be distributed freely over the web.</p>
   <p>The final plenary speaker was <hi> Patrick Hanks</hi> (OUP) who gave a
bravura demonstration of the problems that corpora give lexicographers.
What exactly is it that lexicographers do when they go through the lines
of a concordance assigning each one to some sense or another of a word?
and how on earth do they do it? Hanks has published several papers on
this, and worked with some of the best computational names in the
business (Atkins, Fillmore..) but he's honest enough to say he still has
no definitive answers. His presentation focussed on a few interesting
examples: the word "baked" for example, which seems to require certain
lexical classes (not just edible food stuff, but specific categories of
them) and the word .</p> 
   <p>
      <label>Parallel sessions</label>
   </p>
   <p>In the nature of things, I couldn't attend all of these. The
exigencies of time and space meant that I had to choose to miss
presentations from <hi>inter alia:</hi> Bengt Altenberg (Lund), Wieslaw
Babik (Krakow), Michael Barlow (Rice), Simon Botley (Lancaster), Igor
Burkhanov (Rzeszów), Doug Coleman  (Toledo), Martha Jones
(Nottingham), Dorothy Kenny (Dublin), Bernhard Kettermann (Graz),
Przemyslaw Kaszubski (Poznan), Anne Lawson (Birmingham),  Barbara
Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk (Lódz) , Belinda Maia (Oporto), Michal
Pawica (Kraków), Margherita Ulrych (Trieste), and Maciej Widawski
(Gdansk), whose names I list to give at least some indication of the
geographical spread of participants. What follows by way of review
should therefore be regarded only as  a sample of the concerns raised
and materials discussed -- though  not, I hope, too unrepresentative a
one.</p>

   <p>
      <hi>Stig Johansson</hi> (Oslo) reported on the progress of the <ref target="http://www.hd.uib.no/enpc.html">English-Norwegian parallel
corpus project</ref>, now expanding to include up to a hundred texts in
other European languages, notably German, Dutch, and Portuguese. The
well thought out design of this corpus allows comparison both between
texts translated from language A into language B, and the reverse,
although it is not always easy to find sufficient texts to do this
(there are far more English-Norwegian translations, for example, than
the reverse, simply because it is hard to find comparable texts) In a
separate evening session, he described some of the software developed
for the project, in particular the automatic alignment procedure
developed at Bergen by Knut Hofland and a Windows retrieval package
developed by Jarle Eberling at Oslo. </p>

   <p>
      <hi>
         <ref target="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/BBC_English/summer_school/runtalk.htm">Michael
Rundell</ref>
      </hi> (Longman) gave a pleasant presentation about corpus
evidence for the British fondness of understatement, in particular the
phrase <hi>not exactly</hi> and similar ironic uses. It's probably not
too controversial to say that this was not exactly unfamiliar to those
who had heard him speak at
<ref target="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/ucrel/talc/">TALC
last year</ref>, but none the worse for that.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <ref target="http://www.sslmit.unibo.it/aston/guypage.htm">Guy
Aston</ref>
      </hi> (<ref target="http://www.sslmit.unibo.it/">Forlì</ref>)
contrasted the pedagogic usefulness of large corpora such as Cobuild or
the BNC with that of small specialized corpora drawn from, specific text
types, such as a 14,000 word "hepatitis corpus" in use at Forlì.
Small corpora are more easily managed by the language learner, and their
lexis can be studied <hi>in extenso</hi>; learners can use them to
practice their inductive powers, hypothesizing lexical, colligational or
collocational patterns, which may or may not be confirmed by examination
of large reference corpora. In this respect, it is possible to get the
best of both worlds. </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Akua Anokye</hi> (<ref target="http://www.utoledo.edu/colleges/arts-and-sciences/africana/">Toledo</ref>)
described some interpretative problems in analyzing the transcriptions
of Afro-American folk narratives recorded on aluminum disk by Hurston,
Lomax et al in the late twenties and now stored in the Library of
Congress. She had transcribed some of these recordings, using her own
scheme, and presented a largely impressionistic account of the interplay
between their phonological and contextual features.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Sylvia Shaw</hi> (Middlesex) described how  corpora had
influenced the production and format of the third edition of Longman's
<hi>Dictionary of Contemporary English</hi>. This had included both the
use of  frequency information, derived from large corpora, and
particular attention to typical language learner errors, derived from
corpora of language learners' production. Thus the student can be
advised, for example, of the range of things to which words such as <hi>beautiful</hi>
are typically applied by native speakers, which is much smaller than
that used by language learners, and given advice on how to choose
between near synonyms such as <hi>error</hi> and <hi>mistake</hi>.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <ref target="http://www.bus.bton.ac.uk/Staff/RSalkie/RSalkie.html">Raphael
Salkie</ref>
      </hi> (Brighton) quoted a number of French writers' opinions
about the differences between French and English,  intended to help
translators as rules of thumb (e.g. ). His paper reported some
interesting work on the extent to which these perceptions were born out
by corpus evidence, and gave a brief overview of the
<ref target="http://bmserver.bus.bton.ac.uk/FGNT/BusSchool/Research/LangCent/Intersect.html">Intersect</ref>
project.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Chris Tribble</hi>, (Lancaster, Reading, Warsaw) picking up Guy
Aston's paper on the benefits of small corpora, suggested that for 
class room use, small  corpora were of more use than large as well as
being more accessible.
<ref target="http://sun1.bham.ac.uk/johnstf/palc.htm">His paper</ref>
reported on some experiments using Microsoft's <hi>Encarta</hi> as a
language resource (as well as a source of factual information) noting
that the type of language it contains is very similar to that which
language learners are typically required to produce: brief factual
articles. </p>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <ref target="http://www-clg.bham.ac.uk/oliver/">Oliver Mason</ref>
      </hi>
(né Jakobs) from <ref target="http://www-clg.bham.ac.uk/">Birmingham</ref>
presented what was in many ways an exemplary research report about some
very interesting work he has been doing on identifying statistically the
size of collocation spans, by calculating the type-token ratio of the
words appearing in each position to the left and to the right of the
keyword. The results are striking: different node words exhibit
strikingly different patterns of influence on their neighbours, giving a
visual hint of the extent to which they construct fixed phrases, for
which he proposed the term <hi>lexical gravity</hi>. </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Sylvia Scheur</hi>  (Poznan) discussed several aspects of her
research into the pronunciation difficulties faced by Polish-speaking
learners of English. She had recorded 17 Polish language-learners
reading the same English texts at the start of their course and a year
later, and was transcribing these phonetically (using the SAMPA writing
system for the International Phonetic Alphabet, developed by John
Wells). Students were also asked to assess their own performance, which
produced some interesting comments about their perceptions of English
prosody.</p>
   <p>I gave<ref target="http://info.ox.ac.uk/bnc/papers/burnard96a.htm">
that paper about the BNC  and SARA</ref> again, spiced up somewhat for
this audience by the addition of hints about forthcoming availability of
the corpus outside the EU, and also with the first ever live
demonstration of the sampler corpus.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Philip King</hi> (Birmingham) gave an overview of the
<ref target="http://sun1.bham.ac.uk/johnstf/lingua.htm">Lingua multilingual
parallel concordancing project</ref>, now in its second phase of
existence, with a particular focus on some of the pedagogic software
being developed at Birmingham for its exploitation, its use in
generating course material for student use, and the ability to browse
and search parallel corpora.  It would be interesting to compare the
methods and results of this project with those of the ENPC described by
Stig Johansson, but no-one had the temerity to do so, in public at
least.</p>
   <p>
      <label>Social events</label>
   </p>
   <p>Like other academic conferences this one was oiled by a couple of
very pleasant evenings, drinking, dining, and discussing. Particularly
memorable was an evening concert of baroque music by Teleman and Handel
played on original instruments, followed by a splendid buffet dinner.
This was held in one of the afore mentioned bourgeois palaces and much
appreciated by all. After a couple of glasses of very drinkable
Hungarian wine, McEnery, Ketteman and I were able successfully to
empress all the help we needed to make TALC 98 (hopefully, to be held in
Oxford next July) a reality.   </p>
   <p>I also took the opportunity of a free Sunday at the end of the
conference to visit Arkadia: this is an ornamental garden full of
<ref target="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/Pix/arkadia.jpg">picturesque gothic ruins</ref>, classical statues, and the like, originally
laid out by the local aristocracy in the 18th century, and now a
pleasant enough place for a Sunday afternoon stroll. Getting there
involved a detailed and educational study of Polish regional railways
and  bus services, to say nothing of the refreshment room at 
<ref target="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/Pix/lowicz.jpg">Lowicz
railway station</ref> (which I won't). </p>
