   <head>QUARTERLY REPORT Lou Burnard
Applications Programmer January 1st - March 31st 1979</head>
   <p>2900
Software</p>
   <p>About six weeks were spent producing a new 10 system
for Kent's 2900 Snobol interpreter, which involved some tinkering with
the goodies SIMPLEIO module and much pestering of those (not a few)
who know more S3 than I do. The new 10 system can halve the execution
time of IO-bound programs, largely because the old version used
FORTRAN for all IO. Thorough testing of the interpreter revealed two
or three bugs which were reported to Kent. New documentation for 2900
Snobol was written and then ROFFed.</p>
   <p>An Algol 68/GHOST interface
was written and appeared to work.</p>
   <p>Work on OXMTREAD
continued. Facilities for reading 7-track tapes and tapes written with
Fortran formatted writes were added.</p>
   <p>IDMS</p>
   <p>The Wytham
database went operational in March, after some extensive tuning and
recoding, following consultations with ICL. Fifteen years worth of
private life of Parus Major was loaded into a 10 megabyte database
over one week in February and I wrote a short report on the
experience.</p>
   <p>I discussed a new project, to do with Roman burial
sites, with two people from the External Studies Dept., and designed a
schema for them.</p>
   <p>I chaired two meetings of the Fortran Users
DMUG sub-group here, at which ERCC unveiled plans for the new improved
FISS product, and various proposals for enhancements (chiefly in the
area of usability) were discussed. FISS is apparently still only being
used by ourselves, ERCC and British Aerospace, (Liverpool will have
the 1900 version shortly), though copies have been sold to various
other ICL customers. A valuable side effect of all this was that we
now have a pre-pre-release of FISS FI120, which allows Fortran access
to IDMSX, the extended version of IDMS with many more bells, whistles
and coloured streamers. This is the version which the Assize Court
database will use. I wrote and tested an IDMSX schema for the latter
at the end of March.</p>
   <p>Archive</p>
   <p>Plans to obtain Websters
Dictionary were knocked on the head by a point blank refusal from the
publishers; prospects of obtaining the new A.L.D. however look much
more promising. The last of the <pb facs="Pages/img404.jpg"/>Howard-Hill Shakespeare tapes arrived at
the beginning of March, closely followed by the man himself. OUP are
interested in using the texts as the basis of a new edition, and will
be correspondingly helpful when it comes to giving us copies of other
texts, we hope. I did some preliminary work on reÂ­formatting the
Shakespeare texts using 2900 Snobol, and discovered that the folio
text of Julius Caesar appears to have been mislaid. Richard Sabido
(OUP) handed over three tapes, one of which was unreadable (they
couldn't read it either), the other two being the OUP General
Catalogue and the African Encyclopaedia. These are readable on the
1906A but not yet on the 2980. Susan's indefatigable girls continued
to plod through some minor English classics for me, completing
Wordworth's Lyrical Ballads and Akenside's Pleasures of the
Imagination in a record two weeks. We received a new copy of the Gill
Corpus from the University of Warwick, which has aroused the interest
of a lexicographer working for Heinemanns. Enquiries about texts were
received from the USA, Holland, Germany and Newcastle; a sampler tape
was issued to the Tyneside Linguistic Survey.</p>
   <p>1900
Software</p>
   <p>Birmingham uncovered one bug and suggested one
enhancement in Famulus, both of which were acted upon. New versions of
the package and documentation were released to various places,
including the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the D.E.S. Aston
reported a gross error in Oxeye, which was corrected; new version
released to Aston and to Nottingham.</p>
   <p>Any Other Business</p>
   <p>I
re-joined the DMUG End User Facility Sub-Group: a dedicated band which
plans to define a really usable interface to IDMS for ICL to
implement, by the end of 1979, (see visit reports). I submitted a
paper on our experience using IDMS to ICCH/4, which was accepted, and
wrote a second article on Snobol for publication in the ALLC
Bulletin.</p>
