   <p>This meeting was similar in style and content, if
not in surroundings, to the one I attended in the Highlands two
months ago, except that there were three or four faces new to me
present. On day 1 I applied for and was granted official
membership of the Group as Oxford's representative. Reports of liason
with other groups of similar interests followed, in particular
a Pascal working party which has expressed interest in the
continuing work of standardisation of what ANSI now wish us to
call dbcs. Another interesting indicator of future trends was
the DBAWG's agreement that its distributed DB architecture was
not predicated on an exclusively Codasyl (or indeed ANSI)
architecture. As before the real work of the group continued in its
two subgroups and I stayed with the 'Access Control'
subgroup. After having at our last meeting failed to agree on a
definition of 'action' within an information system, we spent
most of this one failing to a.gree on what a 'rule1 was anyway. On day
1, it had a rather hierarchic element (of, Asimov's laws of robotics);
but on day 2 this was discredited in favour of the view that it was
just a boolean expression 'action X is permitted to role Y if
(arbitrarily_complex_expression) ' A discussion about 'rights' and
'revoking' of rights led to the assertion that rules could also be the
subjects of (meta) rules and indeed attempts to define meta-meta-rules
(which define what happens when the meta-rules defining which rules
currently apply are changed). It was also agreed that the subgroup
needed a dictatorial chair person, which role I was reluctantly
coerced into.</p>
