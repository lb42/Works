ICL Beaumont</head>
   <head type="when">9 November 78</head>
   <head type="event">"Technical Briefing on 2900 VME/B Data Management
Products"</head>
   <p>The purpose of the meeting, organised by ICL, was
to give a fairly comprehensive and technical presentation of the new
range of data-management products now on release, in particular of
IDMSX (the souped-up version of IDMS with extra bells and whistles, at
no decrease in performance) and DDS. In order to add extra facilities
without degrading the performance, a substantial re-write of the base
code has been done, which resulted in a performance improvement of
10%. Adding the extra facilities reduces this improvement to 7%, it
was claimed.</p>
   <p>A nifty plastic binder with lots of technical
details, and a summary of the presentations was handed out, and is
available for inspection in my office.</p>
   <p>I found the meeting
useful, because many of the extra facilities in IDMSX solve usability
problems IDMS users are experiencing now, e.g. the provision of record
type indexes and of set pointer arrays. It was also a very valuable
opportunity to meet the people who are developing the product and to
discuss their future plans on an informal basis.</p>
