   <head>QUARTERLY REPORT L. Burnard January 1st
- April 1st 1978</head>
   <p>IDMS</p>
   <p>The quarter began promisingly
with me commuting to Bracknell in a suit to get some hands-on
experience of using FISS (the Fortran interface to IDMS) and indeed of
5x27 on a 2980 which worked more often than not as well. The swan
schema was successfully implemented there and one test program run
before pressure of other work recalled me to Oxford. At the end of the
quarter I gave a talk to the Zoology Dept. on database techniques and
the use of IDMS which seemed to arouse considerable
enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>2980 Initial Service</p>
   <p>I did my best to make a
lot of noise about the Initial User Service, drafting a User Notice,
rewriting much of the Initial Use documentation and delivering a
well-received if inaccurate presentÂ­ation to the User Group Meeting. I
wrote various macros to make life a little easier for package-users
(and others), viz OXCAF, OX-CARD-INPUT, SNOBOL and
FAMULUS. Documentation on Snobol and on Famulus was written and
delivered to User Liaison last week. Initial testing of SNOBOL
indicates considerable scope for improvement particularly as regards
the I/O. A disturbing number of bugs in the first release of Famulus
also surfaced and were reported to Edinburgh: a new release is due
shortly.</p>
   <p>Archive</p>
   <p>This quarter the number of words in the
Archive passed the 3 million mark, largely as a result of our
acquiring a large corpus from Warwick, containing a most extraordinary
mischmasch of newspaper articles, committee reports, recipes,
instruction leaflets etc. I also received from the University of
Manchester a partial transcript of the A.L.D. and another of written
speech. Negotiations with the firm L. Urdang Inc. are progressing; if
successful they should lead to our acquiring not only a complete
transcript of a new English dictionary but also of various other
reference works. Texts of Keats and Hopkins are expected to arrive by
September, when the Coleridge corpus should also be
completed.</p>
   <p>1900 Software</p>
   <p>Much time was spent on VERA, a
new program for analysing variant states in texts which interfaces to
the cluster analysis routines of GENSTAT. This was finished and tested
in time for Susan to advertise it at an International Meeting on
Textual Criticism in Paris, just. Much time was also spent on programs
for analysing the movements of giant tortoises on the Isle of
Aldabra. Apart from this, and routine software maintenance, the 1906
did not see much of me this quarter. I tested the new version of CLOC,
and found a few restrictions and one bug, which were duly reported to
Birmingham. I have also just obtained a copy of the Bradford 1900 LISP
system.</p>
   <p>Any Other Business</p>
   <p>I continued to write superb
minutes for the Programmers Meeting, and also designed a somewhat less
superb form for logging the activities of Advisory Service. I was
involved (together with Susan and the Professor of General
Linguistics) in the organisation of a series of seminars on
Computational Linguistics to take place next Michaelmas term. My main
extramural activity was attending the ALLC International Symposium at
Aston at the beginning of April, which (despite the highly uncongenial
surroundings) proved to be one of the more successful of the series to
date. I was invited to write a series of articles on Spitbol
programming, recommended to produce a machine-independent Oxeye,
engaged in a full and frank exchange of views on the organisation of
machine-readable archives with both American and Norwegian experts in
the field, and I also picked up some interesting new techniques in
collocation analysis.</p>
