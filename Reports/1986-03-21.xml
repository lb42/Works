    <head type="location"> TO Westfield College March </head>
    <head type="when">21-23 March 1986 </head>
    <head type="event">History and Computing: The inaugural conference of the Association for
        History and Computing. </head>
    <p> This conference aimed to bring together as many as possible of those currently using
        computers as primary research tools or as teaching aids in the historical disciplines, with
        a view to establishing a new learned society, the AHC, with a wide ranging membership
        including universities, research bodies, polytechnics, and local government bodies
        responsible for secondary education. This Catholicism may be one reason for the evident
        success of the event: there were nearly 300 delegates, including several from Germany France
        and Italy, and ten sessions each of four or five short papers, of extraordinary richness and
        variety, with only a few duds. There was also a more or less permanent but changing
        exhibition room featuring assorted micro manufacturers and software publishers as well as
        lots of online demos, mostly on the ubiquitous BBC micro or via JANET at the exhibitor's
        home base. I was alas unable to show off the wonders of CAFS due to the continued absence of
        weekend working on the 2988. </p>
    <p> There were too many papers to summarise individually (it is probable that some sort of
        publication will emerge eventually) so this report simply describes over all trends and
        memorabilia. </p>
    <p> Predictably, there were large numbers of home grown quasi-DBMSs on display, ranging in
        sophistication all the way from data entry systems in BBC BASIC tailored to a particular
        type of historical document up to the all-singing all-dancing current market-leader, the
        German CLIO package. I had previously met this in Gottingen; it is still being re-written in
        C but now has satisfied customers in Austria and France as well, and is stimulating interest
        here. Others mentioned included -yes- Famulus?? which got blush-making praise from a
        Nottingham group and Oracle which was mentioned by several speakers as the obvious choice
        for dbms, despite the presence of a strong SIR-fancying contingent. In fact the conference
        revealed a very healthy eclecticism as far as software is concerned, both Prolog supporters
        and one renegade APL fanatic being given if not equal time at least equal respect. </p>
    <p> Aside from methodological manifesto, some real historical research was reported, largely by
        groups of economic historians. In this category, I found Turner (using multi-dimensional
        scaling to analyse 19th c House of Commons voting practice - which rings a bell) and Riehl
        (using predictive mathematical models to analyse the emergence of the Greek city state)
        particularly interesting. At quite the other end of the educational spectrum, there were
        sessions devoted to methods of introducing computational methods into the undergraduate
        syllabus, and to novel applications of computers in the secondary and below classroom. These
        were very interesting, and oddly complementary. One speaker compared the university teacher
        addressing the post-micro generation to a hunter-gatherer trying to teach neolithic man how
        to increase agricultural productivity - a simile whch seemed to strike several chords. One
        novel CALL application is <pb facs="Pages/ahc-report-2.jpg"/> about to be marketed by
        Longmans: it is a role-playing game in which children are introduced to decision making
        procedures and the role of chance in historical events, by simulating the Palestine
        agreement of 1947. It seemed a good way of teaching people to "think historically" - an
        activity which the charismatic Richard Ennals (who jetted in to chair one session and then
        jetted out again) assured us was worth big bucks in pushing back the frontiers of AI. </p>
    <p> I noted two major trends: <list type="ordered">
            <item> The biggest problem area is still data capture. There is now a widespread
                recognition of the need to capture original sources and to integrate them to some
                extent with a relational dbms. Few seem to doubt that relational is right and
                hierarchic has had it. </item>
            <item> There is a growing awareness of the possibilities for IKBS. Nevertheless for most
                people, the topic of computational history MLE (is more or less equal to)
                quantitative analyses. </item>
        </list></p>
