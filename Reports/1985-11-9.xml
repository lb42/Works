  <head type="event">[Bodleian Curators Meeting; Belinda's Birthday]</head>
  <head type="report"> A NOT VERY USUAL SATURDAY</head>
  <head type="when"> 9 November 1985 </head>
  <p>... began, like quite a few Saturdays lately, with my escorting Sarah
    Daisy, violin perilously perched at the back of her bike, northwards through
    suburban back streets to Miss Chandler's expansive residence in Belbroughton
    Road, arriving around 1040 for a 1030 lesson, as usual. Then I bicycled
    furiously up Banbury Road to do some frugal Saturday morning shopping:
    muesli, brown rice, brown bread, brown beans, caffeine-free tea, fresh fruit
    and a Sunday indulgence, fillet of lamb, extracted from the bone before me
    by a prodigiously fat butcher with a suspicious expression, as if he could
    smell a closet vegetarian polluting his premises. </p>
  <p> ... continued, with my re-escorting Sarah homewards (and the shopping too)
    by 1120. And then grabbing my gown, for the second time this year and my
    script, and heading off frantically for the Computing Service. And then
    bicycling furiously back again having forgotten my bike lock (a heavy duty
    number weighing rather more than the bike itself). And so to the Lecture
    Room, where assorted luminaries of the Computing Service, Libraries Board
    and the Bodleian itself are already fretting about where to put the
    wineglasses, turning on the equipment, testing the view from the back etc. </p>
  <p> For today is the Day of the Visitation, when the Curators of Bodley's
    library exercise their annual right of inspection, ostensibly to count the
    books, in practise to listen to a Latin Oration and then Lunch well. Except
    that this year, as a consequence of, and in spite of, and leaving to one
    side, all manner of complicated university politics and campaigns and
    proposals and working parties and parties prises, they are also going to
    Visit us, in order to see my natty program search the pre-1920 catalogue (S
    to SHERIDAN) at one million characters a second. </p>
  <p> At noon, the few real users of the computer still around are all told to
    leave, and the machine turned over to us. By now, we have been waiting for
    Them to arrive for so long, that we've relaxed to the point of seeing
    whether or not the wine really is cold enough. Consequently it is not until
    the first begowned dignatory enters that we think of checking that what was
    working perfectly well at 1145 is still working at 1215. Needless to say, it
    isn't. Ten minutes of undiluted hell then ensue, during which (a)
    approximately thirty elderly academics rubber neck their way into the room
    (b) the monitor on which I am to do the demonstration continues to say
    COMMENT- A SHORT DELAY WILL OCCUR (c) my Director makes desperate jokes
    about ICL scoring own goals (d) me and the solitary operator on duty, who's
    getting paid overtime for the privilege, try to decide what's needed to get
    the brute moving again. Eight minutes into this, with the notional egg
    starting to congeal on my face, and even as Bodley's Acting Librarian starts
    to make his Introductory Remarks, I notice the unnatural quiet in the
    machine room, and suggest that there really ought to be a printer going, and
    how about an output scheduler as well? Operator grunts, types some special
    operators gobbledegook, terminals spring to life, I sprint back to lecture
    room, elbow my way through assembled subfusc, phew, not a nanosecond too
    soon, we are go for demo. </p>
  <p> As planned, I demonstrate that there are 4 titles in S-SHERIDAN which
    contain the word "Abysinnia", 5 containing words starting with "Abysinn..",
    6 containing words starting "Abxsynn" (where x is a y or an i or even a q),
    and ever so many more when you search for variations such as Ethiopia,
    Aethiopica etc. all of which the wonderful CAFS machine duly does. This
    works a treat. The next one I get wrong, [q3 and q2 or q1 not being at all
    the same as q3 and (q2 or q1) which is what it says in the script];
    fortunately, of the curators present, those who understand this error
    outnumber those who don't, so that the former derive great pleasure from
    explaining it to the latter, and a general feeling of bonhomie (spurred on
    by white wine) takes over from technophobia. The master of Balliol, a force
    to be reckoned with in this context as in many others, desires hands on
    access to the system, and starts hunting for entries about John Wycliffe
    (one was duly found, fortunately). I find the one entry in the catalogue for
    a book printed in the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, as well as a
    breakdown by century. The Curators, not a body of men to stand and gawp, are
    by now in a highly satisfactory state of hubbub. The charabanc arrives to
    waft them away to Lunch at Wolfson, to which, somewhat to our surprise, both
    myself and my Bodleian conspirators are invited. </p>
  <p> The world looks better through the inverted end of a sherry glass with the
    knowledge that there's a lot more of that sort of stuff to come, even better
    when you haven't got to do more than sound like a human being (as opposed to
    one of those computer people) while you get through said stuff. I am seated
    in a place reserved for the Senior Proctor (he couldn't make it, I assume)
    next to the Public Orator himself, who hasn't been to my Oration, just as I
    haven't been to his, which makes conversation a lot easier. Chablis succeeds
    sherry, claret succeeds chablis, to the accompaniment of an unpretentious
    lunch (one cannot trust the Wolfson chef not to experiment, I am told) of
    avocado salad, roast chicken, fresh potatoes and beans, orange syllabub. The
    head Curator makes a short speech; the Acting Librarian makes a longer one;
    I admire the view over the river. </p>
  <p> The charabanc deposits me back at the computing service, somewhat dazed,
    where I regain my trusty bicycle, and speed home through the sunshine,
    realising as I approach that it is already close to teatime in the real
    Saturday world which hasof course been ticking on all this time as a
    background activity. For example, Mr and Mrs Triggs are here to take away
    the spare bed (as arranged yesterday): Belinda fortunately is at hand to
    tell them to wait till Thursday (as re-arranged today). As consolation, I
    ply them (and myself) with duty-free Calvados and enjoy the sensation of
    being reunited with the rest of the massed Burnards, knowing that all things
    which should have been done, have been, and not by me. And that it would not
    be entirely inappropriate for me to go and lie down for a few hours. Which I
    duly do. </p>
  <p> The dark falls on Southmoor Road. The smell of grilling sausages wafts
    slowly up the stairs, indicative of imminent supper for lodgers and
    left-behinds. Did you, dear reader, think I had forgotten the date? Of
    course not! Tomorrow is the tenth of November, as surely as today is the
    ninth, which can only mean that Belinda has to be taken out tonight and
    treated like the Real Woman she increasingly resembles. This year, it has
    been decided, she and four of her peers are to be treated to an Italian
    dinner out, rather than a disco. As far as I can tell, the trouble with
    discos is that Boys don't always come, even when you invite them. More fools
    them, I can only think, as hair is brushed and re-brushed and the genuine
    Fiorucci hairgrip fixed and refixed in place. The four chosen peers (whose
    names are Gilly, Izzy, Maggie and Claire) arrive, promptly at 6.15 for
    pre-dinner sparklers, which occur in the garden with much whooping, after,
    as is only proper, the giving of gifts. Downstairs, Tata Pam, Sarah Daisy,
    Elizabeth Rose and the only lodger in residence stoically munch their way
    through sausage risotto, while we wait for the first of two taxis to waft us
    all away to the far North, at least as far as the Pizzeria in South Parade. </p>
  <p> We have been placed at a large round and a small square table, labelled
    RESERVED, near the door, so that, although we can't easily see the man in
    the kitchen bouncing the dough off the ceiling, we can see passers-by
    studying the menu and pull faces at them. Only Gilly and Belinda dare tackle
    a whole pizza each; Claire and Lilette have different flavours of spaghetti;
    Maggie and Izzy share what turns out to be a somewhat miserly portion of
    lasagne; I content myself with a plate of penne. Everyone drinks coke,
    naturally, except for the iredeemably adult who stick to the house rosso
    with acqua minerale. This Pizzeria serves decent and unobjectionable primi;
    where it excells is in the dolci department. Its banana splits have to be
    seen to be believed, while la coppa mamma mia (anglice, knickerbocker glory)
    is altogether out of the run of the mill. It is therefore not surprising
    that a paltry five girls account between them for five coppas, two cassatas
    and a banana split. Another good thing about this Pizzeria is that (being an
    Italian establishment, albeit in alien territory) it is noisy and cheerful
    and girls who stick paper umbrellas in their hair and go to the lavatory en
    masse do not have to suffer the icy stares they might encounter at other
    establishments. That's all there is to tell about this somewhat unusual
    Saturday really. All five girls, somewhat to my surprise, were delighted to
    be offered the chance of walking home (we can sing drunk songs, said Gilly,
    and later managed quite a few lines of "Tipperary", from who knows what
    atavistic sense of the appropriate) rather than waiting for a taxi again.
    The walk home was rowdy and rapid, if cold. Then a few card games until the
    appointed hour for Other Daddies to turn up and retrieve their offspring.
    (Izzie's was disgracefully late,. and got ticked off by his daughter). Then
    Bed for some, a nightcap for others, and (unless memory deceives me) a
    lengthy dissertation on the clinical manipulation of people's emotions from
    Tata Pam, before I gave up trying to maintain the vertical, and went to bed
    myself. </p>
  <p> An unusual sort of a Saturday; and therefore one I decided, as you see, to
    preserve on floppy disk. Doing so has occupied me for about an hour and a
    half this Sunday: I haven't written anything but Visit Reports and Manuals
    and User Guides for so long I've had a lot of trouble with the style. Can
    you tell, dear reader/user?</p>
