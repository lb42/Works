   <head type="event">Lancaster University Conference (ICAME)</head>
   <p>This was the fifth in a series of annual conferences on Computers
in English Language Research run by a small group of like-minded
linguists from the universities of Oslo and Bergen in Norway, Goteborg
and Lund in Sweden, Nijmegen and Amsterdam in Holland and Lancaster
and Birmingham in England. The like-mindedness consists chiefly in a
concentration on the methodology of corpus linguistics, in particular
the use of computers to analyse large (more than a million words)
chunks of running text. The British Council, ICL, IBM and even a Royal
were also sponsoring the event. This being the first time that Oxford
had been represented at the conference in any form (while we do have
lots of corpora we don't have any linguists), I spent quite a lot of
time explaining that the Computing Service and the University Press
were not the same thing at all, mainly to delegates excited by the
news of NOED, the computerised OED announced the week
before.</p>
   <p>The conference was held in a hotel on the banks of Lake
Windermere, because Lancaster had been unable to find room for it
during term time. It was in fact quite a small conference (about 50)
covering a broad range of varieties of delegate, as well as of
English. (See attendance list).</p>
   <p>Proceedings began on Monday with
a talk by Henry Kucera (a Grand old man of Corpus Linguistics) from
Brown University. He reported some fairly unsurprising discoveries in
the now lemmatised and tagged Brown corpus (e.g. that nouns and verbs
have more inflected forms than do other part of speech). More
interesting was his brief account of work done using a computerised
form of Roget's Thesaurus as the basis of a synonym generator. One
clever part of the design is that it operates on inflected rather than
base forms: you say 'running* and it obligingly gives you 'rushing',
'flowing', 'zooming' etc rather than 'rush1, 'flow' etc. The other
clever part is that definitions are also included so that when offered
'fountain' as a synonym of 'spring', the user can specify that he
actually meant the sort found in mattresses and hence get a different
set of synonyms. The obvious application is in really classy word
processing systems, which is why this particular Roget database is not
currently available.</p>
   <p>Jan Svartvik, who heads the research team
at Lund University which has been working for some time on that
portion of the venerable 'Survey of Spoken English' which has been
made machine-readable, reported on the pauses between speech chunks,
which together account for nearly half of all utterance time,
speculating as to their semantic function and the mapping (if any) of
these chunks to tone units on the one hand, and syntactic units on the
other. His colleagues Anna-Britta Stenstrbm developed further the
importance of pauses as markers of semantic units in speech, a feature
of language the importance of which some of the
<pb facs="Pages/img538.jpg"/>
non-native speakers here did not seem to have assimilated, while Mats
Eeg-Olofsson reported on the dp problems involved in the analysis of a
tagged corpus of 5000 tone units (or whatever they are) using a 16 bit
micro. He presented an intriguingly vague sort of conceptual analysis
based on a methodology attributed to Winograd which looked like a
confused version of entity analysis as practised in the real
world. They are lumbered with dBASE2 to implement the design on, so I
don't think they will get very far for a while.</p>
   <p>Afternoons and
evenings were given over to parallel sessions and I was therefore
unable to hear Peter Littlechild (Camerino) explain how to squeeze one
Mb of text onto a 5 inch floppy, nor yet Mahavir Jain (Delhi) on the
construction of a corpus of Indian English (though I did interest the
latter in the Text Archive and in OCP over dinner next day), nor even
Mette-Cathrine Jahr (Oslo) on relative preferences for the 's and 'of
genitive formations in everyone's favourite corpora. Instead I plumped
for the session supposedly on computer aided lexicology where both
Jacques Noel (Liege) and Willem Meijs (Amsterdam) discussed the
difficulty of automatically parsing dictionary text. The former are
now using STAIRS to generate KWIC indexes to LDOCE and to CED,
primarily (I later learned from prof. Engels) to generate ELT
exercises. Meijs'; project was only announced in March; it will use
the software developed as part of the TOSCA project to transform the
OALDCE text (supplied by the Text Archive) into a database and I have
already asked for a copy.</p>
   <p>The rest of this day was somewhat of a
miscellany: Dirk Geens (Brussels) had nothing much new to say about
his corpus of modern drama; Yang Hui-zhong (Shanghai) on a 1 million
word corpus of scientific/technical English in the making was another
candidate for OTA/OCP; Rodolpho Delmonte (Venice) on complex noun
phrases had no discernible connexion with computing. While attending
to these I missed Matti Rissanen and Ossi Ihalainen's account of work
begining at the University of Helsinki where a large corpus of English
is to be assembled on faintly dubious historical principles (also with
the assistance of the Oxford Text Archive), which I had already heard
all about on the journey up.</p>
   <p>At dinner we were addressed by the
Chancellor of Lancaster University who read a pithy greeting from HRH
Prince Philip and by Nelson Francis (the other Grand old Man of corpus
linguistics) who told one very good joke, alas unrepeatable. I was
sitting next to Henry Kucera and probably annoyed him intensely by
suggesting it was time they started to use predicate logic to express
their grammars.</p>
   <p>Next day's plenary session included Stig
Johansson (Oslo) on types of ambiguity detected during automatic
parsing and Willem Meijs (again) with some rather unsurprising
evidence that people recognise units larger than individual words in
speech, but was mainly given over to reports on the progress of the
Lancaster tagging system.</p>
   <p>Roger Garside (a computer scientist)
typified their grammar as one of 'constituent likelihood'; it works by
generating every possible parse of a group of tagged words as a number
of trees. Probabilistic weighting, <pb facs="Pages/img539.jpg"/>derived from other trees already present in
the corpus, is then assigned each tree using some fairly fancy sums
and the winner added to the corpus once it has been verified by a
linguist. This process now has a claimed accuracy greater than 95%
Geoffrey Sampson (a linguist) gave more details of the tagging system
used and likened their approach to that of case law. Finally, Eric
Atwell described the use of their tagging programs as a spelling
checker superior to (e.g.) the UNIX Writers Workshop in that it would
fault such sentences as "Fill in the pink from" on syntactic
grounds. To test this he needs a corpus of one million words
guaranteed to contain typing errors which he is attempting to get out
of ICL (Portman Rd); I offered to see whether we could contribute any
as well.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon's parallel sessions, I managed by
adroit switching of location to avoid two Belgian papers on CALL, a
lady from Jerusalem on pronominal uses of the word "one" and a loony
who claimed to be able to index abstracts automatically by paying
attention solely to the punctuation. Instead I was able to contrast
British (Fanny Leech) and Dutch (Gert van der Steen) approaches to
writing automatic tagging programs; I think the Dutch win and hope
that I have persuaded van der Steen to let us try out his software
here. Remaining speakers that evening were real linguists: Kjellmer
(Goteborg) on collocations was sound but dull; Tottie (Uppsala) on
types of negation both sounder and duller; John Kirk (a fairly happy
KDEM user from Belfast) rounded off the evening with a scattering of
sample scurrilous Scotticisms, much to the delight of the native
speakers present.</p>
   <p>The conference ended with two plenary
sessions, one covering research at Birmingham and the other at
Nijmegen. John Sinclair (whom I have been trying to meet for approx 5
years) made a forthright statement of the pragmaticist's position on
lexicographic evidence: dictionaries should reflect usage as it is
found to exist in a representative corpus (they have 7 million words
at Birmingham), in terms of both vocabulary and syntax, rather than
historical evidence or linguistic introspection. If this position had
been given more than lip service by the compilers of CED and LDOCE
(both of whom were present looking gloomy and minder-like) then those
dictionaries would look very different. Antoinette Renouf described
work she had been doing on attempting to elicit usage patterns by
tape-recording unscripted encounters between students : this sounded
fun, but methodologically highly suspect. From Nijmegen, Jan Aarts and
Theo van den Heuvel summarised, with justifiable pride, six years of
work on developing high quality software tools for the use of corpus
linguists (somebody had to) and the conference ended with an
impressive demonstration of their culmination: a video (complete with
glamorous dutch lady demonstrator) of the LDP analysis program which
allows happy linguists to page up and down and roundabout sentences in
tree form on a classy graphics terminal.</p>
   <p>In summary this was a
most enjoyable and unusual gathering: Oxford is not renowned for its
linguistics department, nevertheless the effort that we do put into
facilities like the Text Archive and the OCP are much appreciated by
scholars outside the University.</p>
