   <p>DBAWG's annual outing to the Highlands proved somewhat
more intellectually strenuous than usual, partly because poor weather
kept us within doors for most of the time, but mainly because this was
the last opportunity to get the group's proposals for a Data Storage
Description Language (DSDL) into a presentable form before they are
submitted for consideration by the ANSI "Experts' Meeting" in Paris
next month. Consequently I spent most of Friday and Saturday in the
DSDL subgroup going through the syntax paper (78 pages of BNF)
correcting errors, inconsistencies and spelling mistakes and rewording
it here and there to keep it in line with the vocabulary used by the
latest ANSI specification for network database systems, which our
document is intended to complement. The last part of Saturday's
session (finishing around 11 pm) was spent revising and partly
rewriting an eight page document intended to make the case for a DSDL
as an introduction to the syntax paper.</p>
   <p>Other entertainments
included a plenary session in which the standing paper on Access
Control was gently but firmly shot down in flames. Most of my bits of
it remained intact, but it was agreed that substantial restructuring
of the paper was necessary. This will be attempted (at the Open
University) before the next meeting.</p>
   <p>There was a proposal to
publish the group's other major effort this year (a syntax for
distributed database systems) possibly together with other papers in
book form, for which I (naturally) proposed the use of the
Lasercomp.</p>
   <p>There was much informal discussion about so-called
fourth generation packages and some useful (if impressionistic)
comparisons made between various options we might consider for the
VAX.</p>
