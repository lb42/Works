   <p>This was the second meeting of a small (about 10) working
party set up to produce a second report on the exploitation of
CAFS-ISP. The first one was circulated in April this year, since when
some new bits of software have been "productized" and several more
eager guinea pigs appeared. Membership of the group is predominantly
from the public sector (N Thames Gas, N.WGas, Southern Water, OEGB,
Northampton Borough Council) except for a pair of odd balls (Burton's
Management Information Systems and OUCS)</p>
   <p>In time honoured
manner, membership gives access to early information about ICL
thinking and an ICL elbow to twist (Guy Howarth) about our
requirements, in return for a reasonable amount of flag waving on
behalf of the company</p>
   <p>CEGB reported on their recently completed
trial of the GM/CAFS</p>
   <p>combination using huge ISAM files and a
test ICM5 database The former application concerns both routine and
unanticipated maintenance of each of half a dozen power stations, each
of which involves upwards of 100 MB of detailed information Ad hoc and
rapid access to the information by (non-computing) engineers is
clearly essential; it is also used by the Radiological Protection
Board The IEM5 database was a mere 40 Mb development system Full
details of the trial are</p>
   <p>available in a report; broadly
speaking, it entirely endorses ICL's confidence in the QM/CAFS product
as an end-user system, while repeating several of our own minor
usability niggles. They do not use output record types, and they
define macros for their end users; CAFS</p>
   <p>searchable text is not
used because the file containing it is too large and volatile (about
40 Mb/site updated daily); but they planned to use it on a different
system, which they were confident would fit onto only one FD6640 when
completed They did use CM within a TP service, where it slowed things
down, but not much (Southern Water here reported that use of TPMS and
CAFS was causing them great mental anguish largely due to the infamous
software notice QM43 which should not be applied)</p>
   <p>After lunch,
the Working Party's questionaire and the format of its</p>
   <p>report
were discussed in more detail About 30 replies had so far been
received, mostly indicating that actual usage of CAFS is still very
low, although once converted users never look back Several responses
indicated dislike of CM and a need for better
software</p>
   <p>interfaces before CAFS would even be considered; one
(the Inland</p>
   <p>Revenue) opined that CAFS was "too slow". It was
agreed that details</p>
   <p>extracted from respondants who had expressed
a willingness to co-operate would form a significant part of the new
report, together with detailed accounts of the WP members'
applications I therefore agreed to write up our own eccentric usage of
the beast by the next</p>
   <p>meeting, which will be held in Northampton
at the end of this month.</p>
   <p>I obtained (but subsequently lost) a
copy of the draft specification</p>
   <p>of QM 250 and a useful tip about
getting diagnostics out of QM. I also travelled back with the lady
from Northampton BC, who confirmed all our trepidation about PDS110
and added more. They have vast numbers of huge boring old EtE type
files from old systems which they just put through ADRAM and into CM;
while development of new systems seems to go on within user
departments using PDS!</p>
