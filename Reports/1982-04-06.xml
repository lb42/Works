   <head type="event"> ICL CUA Presentation on CAFS-ISP</head>
   <head type="when">6 April 1982</head>
   <p>CAFS-ISP
represents ICL's first step towards machine architecture capable of
supporting "fifth generation" processors and so its launch was
associated with a certain amount of quiet ballyhoo. Speakers included
a person from the DOl, the charismatic d'Agapayeff and even R. Wilmott
himself. d'Agapayeff held up a shiny metal box the size of a postcard
and said that the Japanese were about to flood the market with similar
articles which would have the processing capability of a PDP-11 or two
and that the computer industry had better watch out. The home computer
of the future, he also opined, would be programmed in something like
Prolog and you could forget your BBC Basic. Wilmott produced a number
of curious statistics about such things as the productivity of workers
in the information processing industry and the numbers of terminals
per square foot of office space, and drew some rather forced analogies
with the Agricultural Revolution before assuring us that ICL were
indeed investigating Prolog for internal use. The great thing about
CAFS (of course) is that it makes prolog-type programming feasible on
a more than experimental scale, and thus opens the way to all sorts of
startling innovations in natural-language processing, text searching
and database query languages. The chief drawback of CAFS is that (as a
result of Wilmott's otherwise admirably ruthless rationalisation of
ICL's product range) it will only ever run on S-series
processors. Despite much talk of co-operation with Universities (all
of which so far as I know have P-series processors) therefore, our
only hopes of getting a toe into this particular hot bath at present
seem to be to wait for the X25 interface to CAFS devices promised for
the future, unless of course we can get a new processor …</p>
   <p>After
an excellent lunch, two current CAFS-800 users were wheeled on to
report their experiences: one being W.H. Smith who use it for their 70
Mb mail order file, and the other being Thorn EMI TV Rentals whose
representative said "the CAFS concept is a basic means of getting at
the grass roots information", thus testifying at least to the
excellence of the lunch. Hamish Carmichael (ICL) then gave more
precise details. CAFS-ISP would be a standard product, supplied as
a. hardware module additional to the standard DCM and connected via
standard DCU2s. A reading rate in excess of 1Mb/sec was claimed, while
a dual 2988 with its full complement of CAFS drives could access 80+
gigabytes, be they standard IDMS databases recman files, relational
tables, text files or (a CAFS special) "self-identifying format
files". This capability arose from the integration of CAFS into the
standard IPA jigsaw puzzle, of which only one piece now remains to be
revealed.</p>
