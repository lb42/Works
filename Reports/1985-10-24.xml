   <head type="location"> (a) CINECA, Bologna  and (b) Inst. Linguistica
Computazionale, Pisa</head>
   <head type="when">October 24-31 1985</head>

   <p>(a) CINECA is an inter-university computer centre owned jointly by
five major  universities in North East Italy; it is situated in the
industrial wasteland  surrounding Bologna at a place called Casalecchio.
It provides computing  facilities for reasearch at all of its parent
universities on an IBM mainframe  running CMS front-ending a Cyber 170
and a CRAY, with a solitary VAX running  VMS. Nearly all its users are
scientific, but (largely at the instance of the  PIXI research group,
which had invited me) CINECA has recently purchased OCP  and assigned a
member of its small consultancy staff the job of overseeing all  arts
users.  
</p>
   <p>PIXI, which I was assured stands for "Pragmatics of Italian-English
Cross  Cultural Interaction", is a small research group funded by the
NPI (a  government agency responsible for inter-university co-operative
research  projects); its members are linguists teaching English at the
Universities of  Rome, Parma, Pisa, Bologna and Napoli. I gave them a
short introductory talk  about the problems of text preparation,
outlined the main relevant features of  OCP and then assisted their
leader (a Balliol man, need I say) to demonstrate  how OCP could be used
to operate on a little bit of their corpus. This  currently represents
about seven hours of surreptitious tape-recordings of  people asking for
help in bookshops. Linguistic features such as turn-taking  and stress
are easily encoded for OCP, but 'overlap' (where one speaker  interrupts
another) may lead to some problems. However, the group, which is 
virtually non-computerate, seemed enthusiastic, and the CINECA
consultant was  impressed by the easiness of installing OCP.  
</p>
   <p>(b) The Instituto della Linguistica Computazionale is a specialist
Institute  directly funded by CNR (the Italian National Research
Council) and headed by  the charismatic Antonio Zampolli, President of
the ALLC, Consultant to the  Council of Europe, etc etc, who had invited
me to Italy on his last visit to  Oxford. More or less on arrival in
Pisa, I gave a lecture to about a dozen  members of the Institute,
describing what OUCS is and does, particularly as  regards Computing in
the Arts, more particularly databases; of particular  interest to the
audience were the Greek Lexicon and the Shakespeare Corpus, and  there
was also sufficient technical awareness to appreciate the importance of 
CAFS.  </p>
   <p>
Work done in the five sections of the Institute covers the range of
linguistic  computer applications, from AI to concordance generation.
Zampolli stresses  that all five sections are integrated; the groups
working on automatic  lemmatisation, thesaurus construction and on-line
dictionary applications are  all obviously inter-dependent, and have an
important dependence on the group resposible for the large text archive
at Pisa, but it is harder to see how the  first group I met (headed by
Capelli and Moretti) fitted in. Their work seemed  to me pure AI in the
Knowledge Representation paradigm, using a version of  Brachman's KL-ONE
language, extended to include both general conceptual  structures and
instances of objects related to them in the same structure. They  were
however insistent that their work was intimately  related to the work of
 the remaining parts of the Institute.
</p>
   <p>  At the other extreme I spent most of the afternoon talking to Rita
Morelli, who  is responsible for organising the Institute's two rooms of
magnetic tapes into  a coherent Archive. I described TOMES in some
detail and was rather taken aback  to learn that all their programming
was done in IBM Assembler. Of the tapes  which Zampolli had brought with
him when he brought his Institute out of CNUCE  (the national university
computing centre) into the promised land at via  Faggiola, over two
thirds have now been checked for usability and their  contents
catalogued. The tapes contain 2-3 thousand texts, mostly but not 
exclusively in Italian, varying in size much as ours do. The Italian
texts were  mostly prepared for the Accademia della Crusca for use in
the Italian  dictionary project; the other texts for many different
scholars. One unusual  feature is that all the texts were produced to a
common standard format,  including some quite recondite encoding
features. I offered to include their  catalogue  in the TOMES database,
which seemed to be an acceptable idea, and  would be a major step
towards implementing the Historic Gottingen Agreement. We  also briefly
discussed the notion of a "Text Description Language", that is, a  high
level descriptive language to which varying encoding formats can be 
mapped. I mentioned SGML, which is sort of but not quite what is needed.
  Zampolli had independently proposed researh into a TDL, so there might
still be  some mileage in it, even, who knows, some Euro-funding for the
Text Archive.  </p>
   <p>
Unfortunately, several of the people I would have liked to meet (notably
Picchi,  who is responsible for their dictionary database software and
Bozzi who works  on the thesaurus project) were unavailable through
illness or other  committments. This visit was therefore less
immediately useful than it might  have been; nevertheless it was very
interesting to see at first hand how a  specialised centre of this type
functions. My expenses for the whole trip were  paid by Zampolli's
Institute. Railway enthusiasts will be pleased to learn that,  although
all but one of the numerous Italian trains I took during the trip was 
late (by anything between five minutes and three hours), not one of them
ever  broke down.
