   <head type="event"> ESRC Seminar Series on Cataloguing Computer Files</head>
   <p>
The purpose of this meeting was to present the first published
Review Draft of a Guide to the cataloguing of computer held
files, which has been under discussion and development for the
last two years by a working party organised jointly by the ESRC
Data Archive at Essex and the Edinburgh University Data Library.
Several other organisations had been active at various times in
this or related working parties and most of them  were also
represented at this meeting. These included the British Library,
the Institute of Information Scientists, the Archives Department
of the University of Liverpool, the CCTA, the IUSC, the PRO, DTI,
the Central Statistical Office, NISS and even the Oxford Text
Archive.

Peter Burnhill (Edinburgh Data Library) began his brief 
overview of the Guide by acknowledging the encouragement and
support of the ESRC specifically in its recognition of the
importance of bibliographic control of machine readable data as
a necessary precursor of secondary analyses. He stressed that
the Guide was intended to be a guide, rather than a standard.
Its purpose was to provide information for those wishing to
apply existing standards (AACR2 for the logical structure, MARC
for the implementation) to the cataloguing of machine readable
resources of all sorts. It was therefore primarily - but not
exclusively - addressed to the librarian community. Amongst
specific problem areas identified, Burnhill mentioned that of
the "general material description" - computer software typically
came in many physical forms which might have little relevance
from a bibliographic control standpoint; as an example he cited
the "Aladdin" emulation package for the Atari, which was a box
containing a chip set, a registration card, a manual, and two
(incompatible) diskettes. To describe such heterogenous objects
adequately the Report proposed four major subdivisions:
bibliographic details, sufficient to identify the item described
and its availability; description of the item's subject and
intellectual content; technical information describing the item's
physical characteristics; management and access information
relative to local copies of the items. Most earlier proposals
about how machine readable resources should be catalogued had
tended to blur these ditinctions. Burnhill also gave a brief
history of how the Guide had come into being, inspired initially
by a published discussion (by Sue Dodd) of AACR2 Chapter 9 and
its interpretation. It was clear that new versions of the AACR2
standard would have to deal more thoroughly with the
'intellectual content' of electronic works.

Bridget Winstanley (ESRC Data Archive) circulated a short
discussion paper on the 'next steps' for the working party. She
described possible test vehicles for the proposals of the Guide,
ranging from simple bibliographic lists to fully fledged union
catalogues and (a new buzzword for me though not for the
librarians) something called "Linked" Catalogues i.e. where
software is sufficiently intelligent to search many different
catalogues at different sites. Conversion of the ESRC Archive's
current catalogue (held in the Standard Study Description format)
to MARC could be done automatically. The Bibliographic Control
project at Essex, having looked at a variety of other
communication formats, had reluctantly decided that MARC remained
the only horse in the race, despite its somewhat jaded
appearance. A simple PC-based interactive cataloguing system was
under development, the output from which was MARC records
conforming to the guidelines.

Sue Dodd, as inspiration of the working party's effort, began by
remarking that both the books she had written in the last five
years were already outdated by technological change, but gave no
specific examples. Traditionally, publishers had been the source
of bibliographic information: this did not seem to be the case at
present for the 'publishers' of machine readable data, whoever
they might be, largely for social and organisational reasons. The
advent of the Guide might make it easier for electronic
publishers to provide the required information in a uniform
manner. She spoke of a 'natural tension' between book and
machine readable file standards. For a book, all the required
information was present on the titlepage. Intellectual content,
if required, was as easily accessible as a physical description
(provided you knew how to read). This did not apply to a machine
readable file. She distinguished a useful distinction between the
logical (humanly determinable) characteristics of a file and the
physical characteristics of its carrier and (in my view) a less
useful one between the latter and any system dependency. She
concluded by mentioning three problem areas for bibliographic
control among the facilities already provided by many libraries 
online services (how do you catalogue DIALOG?), works printed on
demand in varying formats, and online works that are constantly
updated.

Marcia Taylor (ESRC Data Archive) concluded the meeting by
pointing to the existence of a Dissemination working party, of
which all present were ipso facto made members, and there was
some general discussion about the best ways of circulating the
proposals in the Guide.
</p>
   <p>

In my view, the Guide itself needs substantial rewriting before
it can be let out of the Librarian community. However its
structure and approach are eminently sound, and it is heartening
to see professional cataloguers entering an arena too long left
to the amateur.
