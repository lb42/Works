Workshop on 1851 Census</head>

   <p>The International Word Processing Exhibition (sponsored
by IT - i.e. you and me and Mrs Thatcher) suggested several excellent
ways of spending £40,000 and quite a few fairly rotten ones. I have
acquired a reasonable quantity of glossy literature about the products
which took my eye and only given my name and address to a small number
of salesmen. Advent Data Products (who provided my free ticket) were
busy demonstrating their amazing printer to someone else but I watched
anyway: it certainly will print just about anything, but only very
slowly. It is still possible to buy acceptable matrix printers for
£600 or less. The most visually attractive standalone system is
undoubtedly Data Recall's Diamond, which has a screen about the size
of an LP record in tasteful (EEC-recommended)
amber-on-brown. Undoubtedly the best from the communications point of
view is ICL's DRS-based Wordskil 8800; inevitably this suffers from
the usual ICL disadvantage of not quite existing yet. Wang systems
also look very good, but only support IBM protocols. My feet were
starting to hurt by the time I found Wordplex and Philips which may be
why they seemed comparatively lacklustre. An aggressive Burroughs
person demonstrated a large box they call a 'content-addressable file
store' and got quite cross when I quibbled that this should imply
rather more than a large ISAM file. The best gadget on display (not
available yet though) was undoubtedly Sony's typecorder. This fits
into the average hard-pressed executive's briefcase and enables him to
dictate messages and wordprocess documents on the same minute cassette
while flying by Concorde, or presumably waiting for the
bus.</p>
   <p>After lunch I arrived at the 1851 Census workshop in time
to hear Prof. Michael Anderson explain how he had encoded his sample
of the 1851 returns for analysis by SPSS. This was one of a series of
workshops sponsored by the SSRC Survey Archive in which historians
(economic and otherwise) are exposed to the possibilities of using the
computer for secondary analysis of large existing data sets. I thought
I should attend not only in order to preach the gospel of proper data
analysis and recoding by Spitbol, but also to keep in touch with the
SSRC Survey Archive, which performs similar functions for social
science data as the Oxford Archive does for textual data, only rather
better.</p>
   <p>With this in mind, I came away with a number of
documents which will be reworded to act as publicity material for our
own Archive.</p>
