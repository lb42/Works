   <p>This three day meeting was
one of the more productive DBAWG events; there has been somewhat of a
lull in activity this year and a feeling that the group was not
heading anywhere particularly interesting or productive. No doubt due
to the fresh Highland air, these tendencies were reversed at this
meeting. Attendees were as usual, with a few faces new to me, notably
a vociferous gentleman from GCTA and a dour lady from
Aberdeen.</p>
   <p>Day 1 was taken up with admin, liaison reports
etc. The ANSI draft proposed NDL (due for publication next month) and
RDL standards had been exhaustively reviewed by WG15 of ISO TC97Of the
comments on the RDL passed back to ANSI for action, the vast majority
had originated with DBAWG; commentary implying further work on NDL was
clearly now a little late in the day. DBAWG"s major concern here was
to ensure that some standardisation body carried on its own work on
DSDL; this had been accepted as a work item by WG15. During the
discussion, several voiced the opinion that in this area, as in so
many others, American public bodies have a tendency to ignore European
comment, however authoritative or reasonable.</p>
   <p>The group then
turned to a lengthy and remarkably vapid paper from a different ISO
group (WG5) on the database environment, on which detailed comment had
been requested. The paper was the only evidence so far available of
WG5's (perhaps over-ambitious) goal of defining a reference model for
any dbms; demolishing it took up most of the rest of the first
evening.</p>
   <p>Day 2 (apart from a report on BNCOD3 which more or less
tallied with the opinions in my own visit report on same) was given
over to three working papers on "New Datatypes"The latter had been
proposed at the January agm as an important work item, but this was
the first occasion that the group as a whole had discussed exactly
what it might mean. Two of the papers, by representatives of Philips
and DCE, were very general, while the third (mine) was very
specific. During the discussion, which was wide ranging, not to say
heated, it became apparent that none of them was really concerned with
what the group as a whole thought "New Datatypes" meant. By midnight
it was apparent that any future work in this area would concentrate on
the use of abstract datatypes (things like Algol68 structures, Pascal
sets etc), despite valiant efforts on my part to tie the matter down
to specifics such as text or graphics.</p>
   <p>For all of Day 3, we
divided into two subgroups (apart from an informal resumption of the
main protagonists of the "new datatypes' controversy).</p>
   <p>Following
the acceptance of the current D6DL as an ISO work item, DBAWG had
agreed to extend its current specification to support the RDL as well
as the NDL draft proposed standards One of the subgroups therefore
concerned itself with this new relational D6DL, and reportedly made
considerable progress.</p>
   <p>The other subgroup, in which I
participated, turned again to the vexed question of Access
Control. This topic is now enjoying a new lease of life, breathed into
it by two recent working papers in which some real syntax has begun to
emerge. Last year's work in defining a reference model of access
control, from the top down as it were, is now static; this years will
be on the definition of the functions necessary to support the
reference model, from the bottom up Several hours of reasonably
productive discussion ensued and promises of some six working
papers.</p>
   <p>Day 3 closed with a plenary discussion of DBAWG's aims
and objectives over the next year; these were much more clearly
apparent by this stage than at the start of the meeting. On the
journey back I had the opportunity of comparing entity models with the
CACI representative, an interesting experience.</p>
