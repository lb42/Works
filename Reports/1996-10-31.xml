   <p>I was invited to deliver the opening address at <ref target="http://www.belux96">A
decade of power</ref>, the third annual conference of the 
Belgium-Luxembourgian SGML Users' Group, held at the Business Faculty of
Brussells University, just down the road from the airport (rather
inconveniently for us <ref target="http://www.eurostar.com">Eurostar</ref>-fanatics).
The day long event was well attended, with about fifty delegates, mostly
from the industrial/publishing community in Belgium and the Netherlands,
though there were also some academics present. There was a small
exhibition, notably featuring  Omnimark, Balise, Adobe, and Fotek, and a
very friendly atmosphere. The day was given over to presentations, which
I summarise below.</p>
   <p>
      <label>Lou Burnard (Oxford University)</label>
      <hi>SGML on the Web</hi>
   </p>
   <p>You can download<ref target="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/wip/Belux/"> the latest version of my
presentation</ref> from my web site, including the overheads. As far as
I remember, I explained at some length why HTML was a Bad Thing for
electronic publishers (this is what the Americans call <q>preaching to
the choir</q>), and rather more briefly  why SGML was a Bad Thing for
the Websurfer in the Street (which is probably what the Americans call
<q>making waves</q>). I also  made a few incautious remarks about
month, which provoked some interest.</p>
   <p>
      <label>Elizabeth Gower (Adobe)</label> 
      <hi>Practical issues in SGML
Publishing</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The practical issues concerned all related to conversion of legacy
data: how to do it, how to make sure you don't get ripped off by the
company you sub-contract to do it, and why it's going to cost you more
than you think. The presentation was slick, professional, thorough, and
aimed fair and square at senior management: an invaluable checklist of
practical things to do (make sure you've got enough MIPS and enough disk
space! make sure your network can stand the load!) and how to benchmark
the process, but not much on different software strategies you might
adopt to do the conversion, or manage the results of doing it. </p>
   <p>
      <label>Norbert Mikula (Philips Semiconductors) </label>
      <hi>Electronic
databooks: proof of concept</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Not content with writing an SGML parser (of sorts) in JAVA
(imaginatively called Cappuccino), Mikula has also turned his hand to
the production of Yet Another DSSSL Engine (or YADE), which uses
Milowski's Kawa scheme interpreter, also written in Java. The context
for these tools is the Philips Semiconductors Electronic Databook, an
application of PCIS, the dtd Philips have developed within the Pinnacles
framework, and forms the basis of Mikula's research at the University of
Klagenfurt in Austria. His presentation was  impressive, and although
only in prototype form, the work he outlined shows great potential.</p>
   <p>
      <label>Milena Dobreva (Inst of Maths and CompSci, Sofia, Bulgaria)</label>
      <hi>Use of SGML by philologists: experiences gained during the
Medieval Slavic Manuscripts Encoding Project</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This paper gave an overview of the trials and tribulations
experienced by a group of Bulgarian philogists in applying the TEI
Guidelines to the problems of describing and encoding medieval Slavic
manuscripts. Dobreva's presentation focussed more on the organizational
and training aspects of the project than its technical content, though
she did briefly present the set of extensions the group had found it
necessary to make to the TEI dtds, which were of some interest. The
facility with which previously SGML-naive users were able to make useful
progress, even in a technologically challenged environment, was very
heartening, while the survey of common problems encountered was
reassuringly familiar.</p>
   <p>
      <label>Benoit LaSalle (Omnimark Technologies)</label> 
      <hi>Using
microdocuments and hybrid distributed databases for building up
hypertext rich content online services</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Exoterica Corporation has changed its name to Omnimark Technologies,
and this paper was presented by its European sales head, rather than by
Eric Skinner or John  McFadden. Otherwise, this was much the same story
as presented at Munich earlier this year: the future lies in <term>microdocuments</term>
(crystals, or document fragments) which can be embedded within
conventional table-like record structure. This is undoubtedly true, but
would be more persuasive if there were evidence of implementations not
simply hacked together from a mass of Omnimark scripts doing clever
stuff behind the scenes. </p>
   <p>
      <label>Paul Hermans (ProText)</label> 
      <hi>Questor: publishing social law to
different media</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This was also a user-report, this time on an electronic publishing
project concerned with course materials for social law. The material
needed different organization for electronic access: for the former, a
browser based on Synex viewport (the engine behind Panorama) was used,
for the latter, Framemaker. The necessary data massage was carried out
by Omnimark. They had begun with three separate dtds, for capture,
hardcopy, and online, one of which also sported ICADD attributes
subsequently abandoned for performance reasons; these had then been
ingeniously combined into a single dtd. Hermans spent some time
outlining the ways in which Hytime linking strategies had enabled them
to organize the material for online searching in an effective way,
before commenting that TEI extended pointers had proved a much easier
option when it came to actually implementing the system with current
SGML tools, which was also heartening.</p>
   <p>
      <label>Jacques Desseyne (Sema Group Belgium)</label> 
      <hi>The SGML Tree
Transformation Process (STTP): processing SGML documents in an
absolutely standardized way</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This was a good introduction to the STTP side of the DSSSL
specification, giving a clear overview of how it works, and why it is a
distinct component of the DSSSL architecture. Deseyne rather fudged the
issue of implementation,  and did not make the expected announcement of
a new Sema product, or not in public at least, but rumours were abundant
during the coffee break. </p>
   <p>
      <label>Raf Schietekat (Fotek NV)</label> 
      <hi>DSSSL: the promise FOSI did not
fulfill </hi>
   </p>
   <p>This was the last paper of a long day, and I found it rather
disappointing. It covered some basic principles of DSSSL in a rather
mechanical way, and did not add much to my understanding of the overall
scope of its formatting language. In particular, I had hoped for some
explanation of what FOSIs are, before they become extinct, but did not
receive one.</p>
