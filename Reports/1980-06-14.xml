   <head type="location"> Kings College, London</head>
   <head type="event">ALLC
Working party on Networks and Databases</head>
   <head type="when"> 14 June</head>
   <p>This working
party was set up by the ALLC Committee about a year ago to investigate
the feasibility of distributing text processing applications amongst a
number of sites internationally, evaluating the effectiveness of
existing comms networks, and to prepare an international directory of
resources such as machine readable texts and programs. Representatives
from the U.S.A.,Italy, Germany and tho U.K form its membership. I was
co-opted to the Working Party at the Cambridge ALLC Symposium,
and, together with a programmer from Swansea, presented a draft report
on the structure of a database to hold information about machine
readable texts at this meeting. The proposed directory would include
information about characteristics, availability and
applications of existing machine readable texts everywhere; as a
first step it will enable the contents of the Oxford Archive to be
catalogued more effectively than at present. The structure proposed,
five interlinked Famulus files, has the advantage (that it can
be easily implemented at Swansea, and subsequently interfaced to an
IDMS database at Oxford for general access. The directory would
hopefully be updated on-line, and might be published using the
Lasercomp, or on fiche. Swansea have agreed to provide labour, and are
investigating the possibility of getting further funding for the
project. More details in the minutes, when produced.</p>
