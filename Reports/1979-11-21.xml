User Group Meeting</head>

   <p>L. Burnard</p>
   <p>This meeting was essentially a
mopping-up operation. All twelve papers (bar one or two) are in their
last or last but one draft. The chief area as yet unresolved is that
of statistics: some discussion on how population stats and
performance-monitoring stats could be collected and used to improve
performance and diagnose needs for restructuring lead to some firm
suggestions.</p>
   <p>An interesting document was circulated on the
subject of security of IDMS databases: it proposed that (after 5X32)
IDMS inline code should be made to run at ACR9, thus preventing
unauthorised access completely.</p>
   <p>I have two sections of the
report to revise; at the next meeting (December) all the sections will
be collected and collated. ICL are to give a presentation on the next
generation of IDMS (200); it should be the same as the one they
recently tried to charge Â£250 for but is free </p>
