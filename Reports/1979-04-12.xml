Meeting</head>
   <p>Brief presentations on the conceptual views supported
by some existing front ends to IDMS systems. R.Haydock (Plessey)
described the structure supported by their homegrown interface to 1900
IDMS; Ed Dee (ERCC) summarised work done by M.Kay on a relational
subschema and two speakers from ICL gave short accounts of the FAME
('hierarchic') interface and of the FORAL ('binary') interface
respectively. The MOD (OPCON) spec for a query language mentioned at
the last meeting was distributed and I have a copy if anyone is
interested. C.Chang of ICL also spoke on GPLAN, a simple interface to
IDMS which however makes some unwarranted assumptions about the
structures represented. Of these presentations, only that on the
relational view seemed to me to be of much use, the others being
somewhat perfunctory and ad hoc. The Plessey product was also of
interest in that it had evolved q</p>
   <p>uite naturally from software
originally written to support their conventional flatfiles during
their changeover to IDMS. Dataskil were ^elieved to be marketing a
similar product.</p>
   <p>There was some (fairly murderous) criticism of
the draft section-headings for the final report proposed by J.West
(Oxfordshire CC); much of this was re-worded and re-ordered. Various
people were nominated to write sections describing the conceptual
views discussed at the meeting: I got stuck with the binary view, as a
prize for having read the article in question more recently than the
ICL speaker.</p>
