    <head type="event">Computers and Teaching in the Humanities, 1988 </head>
    <head type="location">University of Southampton</head>
    <head type="when">[Dec 13 to 15, 1988]</head>
    <p> This was the second conference on the theme of Computers and Teaching in the Humanities to
        be organised by the Office for Humanities Communication and the University of Southampton,
        with the support of the ALLC (Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing), CTISS
        (Computers in Teaching Initiative Support Service) and the AHC (Association for History and
        Computing), and some sponsorship from IBM. It attracted a similar mixture of attendees to
        that of the preceding conference, more or less evenly divided between academic staff from
        both universities and polytechnics with a third estate drawn from the growing body of arts
        computing support staff. It was unlike the previous conference however (also held at
        Southampton a year ago) in two respects. The first conference had resembled a bazaar, with
        numerous parallel sessions organised as workshops introducing specific applications areas
        with the aid of a volume of essays (since published as <title>IT in the Humanities</title>,
        ed Rahtz, Ellis Horwood, 1988). This conference built on the evident interest generated by
        the first, laying a greater stress on the practical problems of introducing computing tools
        to the undergraduate curriculum. It also had a more unified programme, exemplified by the
        conference subtitle 'Redefining the humanities'. To many delegates, it seemed, the chief
        effect of the introduction of computing had been to provoke a re-evaluation of the methods
        and priorities of teaching methods in the humanities, quite independent of any technological
        considerations. </p>
    <p> The conference was opened by <hi>Peter Denley</hi> (Westfield College) who, as secretary
        general of the Association for History and Computing, is well placed to deliver a 'sociology
        of computing in the humanities'. He began by describing the rise of humanistic scholarship
        itself in renaissance Italy, stressing its emphasis on rhetoric and purity of language,
        together with its importance as a way of both defining and sustaining the growth of a
        secular educated elite. Movements as successful as renaissance scholarship inevitably
        distort their successors' perceptions of them; nevertheless, Denley argued, some of the
        problems currently faced by the Humanities can be related to the change of direction
        implicit in the reasoning of the first Humanists. It could be argued that emphasizing the
        purity of classical Latin above the Latin vernaculars of the middle ages had replaced
        practical linguistics by arid philology, while the emphasis on classical education as
        vocational - on rhetoric as a necessary political accomplishment - was clearly a two-edged
        sword. If the humanities were purely vocational, what was the function of humanistic
        research? A new agenda was needed, Denley argued, which recognised and reaffirmed the
        fundamental importance of the humanities, rather than regarding them as a useful collection
        of skills. As to computing in the humanities itself, he suggested, it was time to take
        stock: the role of IT in the arts course should be more than just to impart necessary
        skills, like word-processing. Discipline-specific training was important, whether or not it
        used the computer. Yet the structure of arts computing as it currently existed did not
        always encourage new ideas: there was no career structure for the strange hybrid characters
        who currently become arts computing advisors. For Denley, history and computing go hand in
        hand: history, as a way of handling information, demonstrates the complexity of knowledge,
        while a database system enforces rigour of analysis, by requiring that events fit into a
        structure. The Humanities, he concluded, needed urgently to <pb
            facs="https://github.com/lb42/Works/tree/master/Reports/Pages/cath88-report-2.jpg"/> reassert their importance and their relevance in the
        evolution of information processing. </p>
    <p> A rather different perspective was offered by the next speaker, <hi>Tom Stonier</hi>,
        Professor of Science and Society at Bradford. His message was an evangelical one of
        unbridled prosperity for all, just around the corner. In the nineties, he said, education
        will absorb more of the GNP than anything else. Pursuing this rather odd economic metaphor,
        he pointed out that human resources were the only sort of capital which could be made to
        appreciate, by means of education. Like Denley, he felt that training for skills alone was
        short sighted; unlike him, he was confident that education and material progress would go
        hand in hand. Today's pupils would have life expectancies of a century and enjoy enormous
        material wealth, apparently caused by extensive use of robots and improved factory farming
        techniques: there would be guaranteed income for all. Doubters in his audience were exhorted
        to learn from the past: the purpose of history was (of course) to enable us to forecast the
        future. We should abandon the protestant work ethic, stop making a living and learn how to
        live. Computers are the greatest pedagogic devices since grandmothers. When the information
        operatives take over, their level of education will necessarily preclude totalitarianism. A
        materials based society evolves through competition, but an information based one develops
        only by means of cooperation. And so forth. Such millenarianism seemed to a number of the
        audience not only foolish, but also dangerously foolish, given the increasing
        marginalisation of the humanities to which Denley had already drawn our attention; however,
        as a morale booster, this was a most amusing and effective speech. </p>
    <p>
        <hi>David Bantz</hi> (Dartmouth College) was considerably less charismatic but perhaps more
        reasonable. His presentation promised to address the extent to which educational problems
        were solved by computing methods and whether computing methods might not undermine
        traditional humanistic values, by being inimical to the 'great conversation of ideas' which
        Wayne Booth sees as characterising the humanities, by over-valuing reductionism and
        calculation at the expense of reasoning. He made several sound criticisms of the current
        state of the art in computer aided criticism and computer aided learning systems (for
        example, the way that most historical simulation systems permit of only one right answer,
        the 'drill and kill' style of CALL etc.), but had little positive or practical to propose
        other than to point out that computing hardware should be regarded as an expense item rather
        than a capital investment, since a four year old machine is useless. We learned that at
        Dartmouth, as at Bradford, all students are required to buy their own machines (Macintosh)
        and that 85% do, at a special price of $1500-2400, not so expensive when set against tuition
        fees of $20,000 p.a. </p>
    <p>
        <hi>David Miall</hi> (College of St Paul &amp; St Mary, Cheltenham), in one of the more
        thought provoking papers of the conference, talked of a crisis of belief in the humanities.
        Like Marlow's Faustus, the modern day humanist feels that all the learning at his disposal
        has failed to give him power. The Humanities are not about the acquisition of knowledge, but
        of transferable skills, the purpose of which is to change people's feelings and raise their
        consciousness. Miall then considered a variety of ways in which the introduction of the
        computer in the classroom helps this by defamiliarising a text, by interacting with and
        challenging affective models, and by changing the nature of student/teacher relationships,
        of which he gave a detailed and impressive discussion. The teaching of literature in
        particular, he concluded, is concerned in the nineties with re-reading, rather than <pb
            facs="https://github.com/lb42/Works/tree/master/Reports/Pages/cath88-report-3.jpg"/>reading, for which tools such as hypertext are eminently
        well suited. </p>
    <p> This was followed by a rather weak paper on the use of a standard text retrieval package
        called Personal Librarian, used by every student at the Stevens Institute of Technology to
        access the 7 Mb of set texts used in a course on the History of Science (<hi>Ed Friedman</hi>), and a
        rather stronger one on the implications of hypertext for poetry teaching by <hi>John Slatin</hi>,
        from the University of Texas at Austin. This was of interest more as a demonstration of what
        tools such as HyperCard look like from the perspective of an English literature specialist
        than for any concrete results presented. <hi>Alan Dyer</hi> (Lanchester Poly) picked up the same
        theme in his presentation, which concerned the way in which computing skills necessarily
        spanned the division between the traditionally linear 'readerly' skills and visual or
        spatial skills. He described, and later presented, an interactive hyperfiction produced by
        one of his students as an instance of what could be achieved when creative people were
        offered suitably powerful and easy to use tools. </p>
    <p> <hi>Sebastian Rahtz</hi> (Southampton) gave a rapid but detailed description of the Southampton/York
        Archaeological Simulation System, in which a database of archaeological information is
        front-ended by something that looks suspiciously like a computer game, but which reportedly
        enables students to leam resource management. He also described the 'arch_help* system
        developed at York, in which a tailored form of the DEC mainframe Help system is used to
        provide students with organised information about courses, lectures, booklists and even
        accomodation details. Both systems represent a shift in stress away from 'teaching about the
        computer' to 'teaching with the computer'. <hi>Charles Henry</hi> (Columbia) initially treated us to
        a brief survey of the pedagogic importance of visualisation in cognition and memorising,
        from Pestalozzi to neural nets. His subsequent attempt to use the insights gained in
        analysing the structure of the Old English epic <title>Beowulf</title> was fascinating but
        too short to be convincing. </p>
    <p> <hi>Arthur Stutt</hi> (OU) began by quoting Umberto Eco's definition of a novel as a machine for
        generating interpretations. The artist, he argued, has always been ready to apply
        technology: the special contribution of the computer should be to facilitate processes
        otherwise impossible. Pointing to the importance of argument in humanities, he made a good
        case for extending the traditional single explanation school of expert systems to cope with
        the traditional formal stages of argument. He did not draw a parallel between the
        renaissance view of rhetoric as an essential component of the humanities on the one hand
        and, on the other, the need to teach techniques of argument as, in Gardin's phrase,
        'propositions which mutually support each'. </p>
    <p> <hi>R.A. Young </hi>(Dundee) also dealt with ways of formalising knowledge, but from the point of
        view of the professional philosopher. He identified a tension between the different
        attitudes to conceptual processes implicit in the construction of formal logics by
        philosophers in the Russell tradition, on the one hand, and the need to make expert systems
        that behave 'as if intelligent which characterise knowledge engineering on the other. There
        was a need for synthesis, not least because of traditional philosophy's abilities to deal
        with inconsistencies and ethical issues generally mishandled or ignored by the knowledge
        engineering paradigm. </p>
    <p> <hi>Paul Davis</hi> (Ealing College) described a hybrid music system, and indeed performed on one,
        after dinner. He gave a brief survey of various 
        <pb facs="https://github.com/lb42/Works/tree/master/Reports/Pages/cath88-report-4.jpg"/>approaches to the synthesis of music,
        stressing the importance of the performer in designing appropriate interfaces for digital
        music systems and asserted that music science was an area rather than a discipline. Coming
        at the end of a long and intellectually demanding day, his presentation seemed a little
        under-powered. </p>
    <p> <hi>Lynette Hunter</hi> (Leeds) began by attempting a structural analysis of contemporary computing
        mythology, in terms of the dominant myths of the Western post renaissance man-made world.
        The machine offered an illusory promise of freedom from drudgery by its power over
        semiotics, mediated by the magical powers of the shaman (or computing advisor) and vicarious
        participation in the club culture of the technocracy. But (as David Miall had already
        remarked) it conferred only the appearance of power. She then described recent changes of
        emphasis in the computing component of the Leeds arts courses. Reductionism and the myth of
        exactitude were inimical to humanistic skills of analagy and metaphor. The place of the
        computer was to help in marshalling facts and memory, and so it fitted better into courses
        dealing with textual editing or bibliography, where classification skills and principles of
        selection needed to be taught. </p>
    <p> <hi>Alison Black</hi> (Reading) gave an interesting and well-presented paper on the differing
        reactions and achievements of students introduced to designing documents on paper and on
        screen. Her talk was effectively illustrated with examples of projects undertaken by the
        students and by statistics drawn from questionnaires aimed at assessing student reactions at
        different stages of their exposure to the different methods of document design. Her analysis
        of the way new technology affects working practices was clear and convincing as was her
        warning that whilst WYSIWYG desktop publishing has a lot to offer the design student, we
        should not be so dazzled by its superficial merits as to forget its limitations and to
        abandon more traditional methods of document design. </p>
    <p> Cell biology was the somewhat suprising subject of the demonstration provided by <hi>Wendy Hall</hi>,
        the object of which was to present a hypertext system developed at Southampton with
        HyperCard. This linked images held on videodisc (some 54,000 images per side) with extracts
        from relevant textbooks, adding sound and animation where appropriate. Although this
        particular project was not humanities based, Wendy Hall was quick to point out the general
        applicability of the technology and the pedagogical methods behind it. In his paper
        Videodiscs and the Politics of Knowledge', <hi>Roger Martlew</hi> (Southampton) returned to a key
        theme of this conference: the relative roles in the classroom of the teacher, student and
        computer. Like David Miall and the DISH duo, he argued that traditional styles of Humanities
        teaching impose specific roles on both lecturer and student which computers had the
        potential either to fossilise or to radicalize. He clearly felt that recent pedagogical
        developments in secondary education were equally applicable at the tertiary level, and that
        the lecturer 'must cease to be a controller of knowledge, and must become a manager of
        learning'. The link between Martlew's archaeological videodisc and the politics of knowledge
        became slightly blurred in the talk, but recourse to the abstract of his paper sets us back
        on the right track with the reminder that the control of access to visual information in
        archaeology confirms the lecturer's power over the educational process'. The videodisc
        controlled by a lecturer could be used in the same didactic way as the traditional 'chalk
        and talk' methods of teaching; the videodisk controlled by the student was equally possible,
        if the lecturer has the courage to renounce power for the sake of pedagogy. </p>
        <pb facs="https://github.com/lb42/Works/tree/master/Reports/Pages/cath88-report-5.jpg"/>
    <p> The last full session of the conference was concerned with three major teaching packages. In
        the first, <hi>Frank Colson</hi> described and demonstrated the HIDES CAL software package, used at
        Southampton as an Important part of the special subject component of the history degree. The
        software runs on a network of PS/2s located in the University library, and presents students
        with a structured walk through documentary sources, supported by impressive graphics. It was
        claimed that students enjoyed using the system, and that it also lead to their making
        greater use of original (noncomputerised) sources. In the second <hi>Susan Hockey</hi> and <hi>John
        Cooper</hi> described, and <hi>Jo Freedman</hi> demonstrated, the 'Oxford Text Searching System',
        developed at Oxford with CTISS funding to encourage arts undergraduates to use concordance
        and free text searching software in their study of set texts. Finally, <hi>Nicholas Morgan</hi> and
        <hi>Richard Trainor</hi> described (but did not demonstrate) some of the principles underlying the
        development of the highly successful DISH project for teaching history at Glasgow. They
        reiterated the changes in the teacher-student relationship made possible by the use of
        computers: the transformation of the instructor from teacher into guide and the resulting
        emphasis on exploration, and on the diversity of insights resulting from a variety of routes
        through the material offered. </p>
    <p> The conference was closed by <hi>Nigel Gardner</hi> (now with ESRC) whose valedictory address as head
        of CTISS indicated that the Initiative had been less succesful as an exercise in
        institutional change than in causing reassessment of the requirements of specific
        disciplines. The next round of CTISS funding (announced at this conference by Gardner's
        successor, <hi>Jonathan Darby</hi>) was thus aimed specifically at setting up topic-oriented 'centres
        of excellence', which would need to address more precisely such matters as project
        management, staff training, resource control and evaluative procedures. Gardner also
        suggested that there was a shift in the role of computing centres which, if they were to
        survive at all in the world of the individual work station, needed to re-emphasize their
        role in providing administrative computing facilities, and support for telecommunications
        and 'learning resource centres' (what we used to call libraries). </p>
    <p> A somewhat sporadic general discussion followed this closing address, but did not really
        bring together the two major themes that had run through an unusually well-balanced and
        unified programme. The first is that with or without the presence of a computer terminal in
        a classroom, teaching methods in tertiary education must move away from the traditional
        master/disciple roles which the availability of hypertext systems and videodiscs are
        beginning to expose and challenge. Secondly that whilst new technology has a lot to offer
        the humanities, particularly teaching in the humanities, a great deal of caution and
        selection should be exercised in the manner and degree to which it is applied. In
        retrospect, though little was actually said about redefining the humanities as such (except
        by those who wanted to annex computer science), quite a lot of thought had evidently gone
        into redefining the teaching of the humanities. Several speakers referred in passing to the
        copyright problems implicit In using electronic materials for teaching purposes: this has
        been a recurrent area of concern, and it is to be hoped that a special session at some
        future conference will address it explicitly. </p>
