Meeting of ALLC</head>
   <p>The International Meeting of the ALLC for
1977 had a unifying theme - the role and organisation of a corpus in
literary and linguistic study, hence my presence there. About 70
people, mostly European, attended. In the morning there were brief
presentations from (l) Theo Bungarten which was all in German and
incomprehensible (2) J. Neuhaus, who is associated with Spevack at
Munster, where a lot of interesting work is being done on the
Shakespeare corpus, with the aid of the chronological english
dictionary, (3) Sture Allen of the Swedish Logotek, an ongoing archive
of all Swedish current newspapers, at Goteborg. These were followed by
a general panel discussion, in which Charles Muller (Strasbourg) gave
a few useful cautions on the indiscriminate use if statistics which I
had never heard said in French before, and Prof. Al (Amsterdam)
stressed the relevance of a corpus of linguistic practice in view of
current thinking about socio-linguistics. There was much discussion on
the well-worn theory of corporal homogeneity, but no firm conclusions
were reached.</p>
   <p>There was a break for lunch during which the
serious button-holing of the day began. I met Stan Bootle (who used to
work for Univac and now sells a sort of primitive artificial
intelligence package to business men) and A. Van Wijngaarden. I tried
my best to get Spevack and Neuhaus interested in visiting Oxford,
since their research seemed the most interesting currently being
undertaken with the use of computers. I exchanged names and addresses
with various others.</p>
   <p>After lunch we were reconvened as the ALLC
AGM, an altogether more parochial affair. There was a certain amount
of mutual self-congratulation in evidence, reflecting the various
political machinations that have been proceeding in the executive of
the Association, Susan has now been elected to the Committee with a
large majority: several people also expressed admiration for the work
being done at Oxford under her mantle. I spoke briefly on the Archive,
and distributed copies of.the Catalogue. I also learned the
whereabouts of some other texts previously unknown to me (in Denmark
and in Belgium) and made efforts to obtain copies of them.</p>
   <p>In
the evening the buttonholing resumed, over large quantities of Belgian
beer, fruit and nts, and broke up for dinner around 2100h. I was then
taken on a tour of the nightspots by John Allen (Manitoba) and his
Belgian chums which, however, did not constitute official
business.</p>
