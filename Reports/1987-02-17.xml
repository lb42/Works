   <head type="report">VISIT REPORT</head>
   <head type="location"> Novotel,
Hammersmith </head>
   <head type="when">17 February 1987</head>
   <head type="event">The Sequent Lectures</head>
   <p>Along with
several thousand other punters I received an invitation to the first
series of "Sequent Lectures" among the usual spring tide of junk mail;
as did several hundred others, I decided it might be worth a visit,
since it was free and featured most of the dbms I know and love. The
event was held in the unspeakably awful Novotel, which is largely
composed of multi storey car park, and had three parts. In part one,
an earnest American salesman explained very slowly why Sequent
machines are so fast (and reliable and wonderful and cheap). This I
found mildly informative, never having paid the company much attention
before; the parallel architecture (lots of stripped down VAXes hanging
off a superfast bus) sounds remarkably sensible, providing that you
can take advantage of it. To do this properly, however, you clearly
need so pretty smart programmers. My jargon detector popped its dial
on the phrase "We have architected that [i.e. Oracle's use of
background processes] on the Sequent" and failed to function for the
rest of the morning.</p>
   <p>Part two came after coffee and comprised
three two-stage sessions held in parallel (another case of Sequent
architecting). These were supposed to be for Sequent's favourite
software vendors to endorse the message by explaining how they'd taken
advantage of the wonderful box in their implementations: predictably
they turned out to be fairly low key sales pitches with only token
gestures in this direction. Products featured were Ingres, Oracle,
Informix, Unify and The Office Smith. I missed all of Unify (it's a
supposedly high performance TP-type system hosted under UNIX), Oracle
(heard it all before) and also all of the technical seminar on
parallel programming (from which however I did steal a programming
guide). The Ingres speaker seemed proudest about Ingres' Visual
Programming (Trademark) and its "state of the art" query optimiser. It
exploits the Sequent architecture by running front and back end
processes on different processors, as does Oracle, I assume. The
Informix speaker was proudest about their 4GL; he did however announce
the new Informix-TURBO which can be used to beef up multi-user large
scale UNIX implementations (not however noticeably using parallel
programming techniques) amd also DATASHEET ADD-OM with which you can
make your Informix-SQL database look just like Lotus 1-2-3. There's
progress. Office Smith turns out to be fairly drab hierarchic text
indexing system for UNIX boxes only. The speaker clearly felt rather
defensive about this ("relational is just a small subset of database
technology") and rightly so. It uses B-trees and compresses index
terms rather like those speed-writing adverts (KN Y RD THS?); one
thing in its favour is that it was designed to be bilingual, emanating
as it does from the Canadian Government.</p>
   <p>The main event of the
day was Dr Rob Wilmott's Vision of the Future, an inspirational little
number, featuring lots of graphs showing sharply divergent lines with
labels such as "Shipped MIPs", "Price/Performance<pb facs="https://github.com/lb42/Works/tree/master/Reports/Pages/img483.jpg"/> Learning Curve" (and only 3 spelling
mistakes) etc etc. Fortunately for the innumerate, the lessons Dr
Wilmott wished us to take home were not too difficult: (1) lots of
small machines is better value for money than one biggie (2) progress
is being impeded by fuddy-duddy conservatism and the deadweight of
current software investment (3) OSI standards are a Good Thing, and
are Happening. Likewise, UNIX, C etc. These messages were all dressed
up rather fetchingly with the usual sort of stuff about the imminent
collapse of the British non-manufacturing industry and the appalling
levels of ignorance in British management. To fill the latter gap, our
Rob has -surprise- started a new management consultancy called OASIS
which will help you "go multi-vendor" and transform your software
productivity before the astonished eyes of the competition breathing
down your neck. Question time provoked an unexpected smear on
government collaborative ventures, and (with reference to whether IBM
would ever get involved in parallel architectures), quite the best
mixed metaphor of 1987, so far, viz "Once the benchmarks are on the
table, you will see all Hell break loose".</p>
   <p>A nominal lunch was
provided, after which I trekked across London to visit the British
Library's Research &amp; Development Division, deep in the heart of
Soho. It is possible that they would be willing to fund a one year
research post here to assess the actual and potential uses of machine
readable texts, which would also help keep the Text Archive on its
feet. I spoke to Terry Cannon, who was encouraging.</p>
