I was invited to give a number of talks at the University of Oslo as
part of a small conference organized by the new inter-faculty Text
Laboratory set up there, in collaboration with the  Department  of
English and American studies, but with visiting guests from other
linguistics departments at Oslo, and from the Universities of Jykslava
(Finland) and Lund (Sweden).  The emphasis was on corpus linguistics
and encoding; between twenty and thirty staff and research students
attended over the three days of the conference.

Willard McCarty from the University of Toronto's Centre for Computing
in the Humanities began the first day with a detailed presentation of
his forthcoming electronic edition of Ovid's Metamorphoses, which
continues to be a fascinating example of just how far the humanities
scholar can go with an ad hoc encoding scheme. I then gave the usual
rapid canter through the TEI Guidelines, their milieu and architecture,
which gave rise to some quite useful discussion before we broke for a
substantial lunch. In the afternoon, Willard and I spent some time in
the Text Laboratory, trying to install the very first BNC starter set
(in my case) and checking email (in his). The Lab has a large Unix
fileserver (some kind of DEC machine, since it runs Ultrix), and a room
full of Windows and MACs connected to it via ethernet. We saw no-one
else trying to use the equipment while we were there, but the Lab has
only just begun operations.

On day two of the conference, Willard gave a talk which began
promisingly by outlining the history of concordancing and concordances,
from the middle ages onwards, but then became an overview of the
features of TACT, which did little to improve my opinion of the design
of that loose baggy monster of a concordance program. I then gave the
usual rapid canter through the BNC, which aroused considerable
interest. There were several intelligent questions about the design and
construction of the corpus, and the accuracy of its linguistic tagging.
I was also able to do my bit for the European Union by pointing out
that a "no" vote in Norway might make it more difficult for us to
distribute copies of the BNC there (the day before I arrived the
Swedish referendum had confirmed Swedish membership; while we were
there, rival campaigns on either side of the Norwegian referendum were
in full swing).

During the afternoon, Willard and I were (independently) esconced in
offices to act as consultants for a couple of hours: I spent most of my
time re-assuring a lady from the German department that the TEI really
could handle very simple encodings as well as complex ones, and
rehearsing with her the TEI solutions to the usual corpus-encoding
problems.  Oslo is collaborating with Finnish and Swedish linguistic
researchers in the development of a set of bilingual corpora
(English-Finnish, English-Norwegian, and English-Swedish), so I also
spent some time discussing and reviewing the project's proposed usage
of the TEI Guidelines. Bergen and Oslo have developed a procedure for
automatically aligning parallel texts in English and Norwegian, which
appears to work reasonably well, perhaps because the languages are not
so dissimilar. I rather doubt whether automatic alignment of English
and Finnish will be as easy, but the Finns seemed quite cheerful about
the prospect. In the evening we were taken out for a traditional
Norwegian Christmas dinner, comprising rotten fish, old potatoes, and
boiled smoked sheep's head, washed down with lots of akvavit: not as
nasty as it sounds, but twice as filling.

The final day of the conference began with an excellent talk by Doug
Biber, from Northern Arizona University, describing the use of  factor
analysis in the identification of register within a large corpus of
materials in three languages (English, Korean and Somali). Biber's use
of statistics is persuasive and undogmatic; the basic method was 
outlined in his book on speech and writing (1988) but its application
to cross-linguistic (or diachronic) corpora is new and provoked
considerable discussion. 
</p>
   <p>
This was followed by my swan song at the conference, a real
seat-of-the-pants nail-biting event, being my first ever attempt to
describe and then demonstrate the BNC retrieval software running (on
Willard's laptop) live and in real time. As a result of careful
pre-selection and late night rehearsal, I'm relieved to say that the
software did not crash once, though my ability to control Willard's
laptop's track-ball in public was frankly pitiful. SARA herself
attracted favourable reaction, in particular because of the system
design. Interest was expressed in the idea of extending her
functionality to cope with the display and searching of parallel
TEI-encoded corpora: not a task I think we will be undertaking
ourselves in the near future.

This was a relaxed but far from vacuous three days, with ample
opportunity for discussion and debate in pleasant surroundings. Sincere
thanks are due to my host, Stig Johansson, and his department for
arranging it and funding my participation.
