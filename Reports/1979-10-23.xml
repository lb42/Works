   <head type="location"> West
Midlands Gas</head>
   <head type="event">ICL DMUG IDMS
Subgroup</head>
   <head type="when">23 Oct 79</head>
   <p>This group
continues the task of reviewing the entire range of IDMS-centred
software on 2900 systems, aiming to prepare a report by the end of the
year. Each product is briefly described, any problems in its
operability/ performance/usability outlined and a list of required
enhancements drawn up, usually after much discussion within the
group. The group's report will be ready in time to affect ICL's plans
for IDMS 300. The main bodies represented at the group are: BBC, BNOC,
BOG, CAA, MOD, Post Office, WMG, RACAL. Universities are unusually
heavily represented on this subgroup: in addition to myself, the
secretary is from QMC and there is usually a representative from
ERCC.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, reports were presented on the IDMS base
product, Pfix, Database Load, Data Display, Recovery, IDMSK facilities
and on the Fortran Interface. I also got the opportunity to report a
new bug in the Fortran interface and to pick up news of a new facility
in Data Display.</p>
