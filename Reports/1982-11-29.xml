   <p>I am sorry
to have to report that this expensive and over-subscribed
event turned out to be little more than an extended commercial
for BP's super new all integrated management information system
and for the (horrible IBM) systems analysis package they used to
create it. Even the three non-BP speakers allowed onto the platform
eventually provided little more than an object lesson on how to sell
ancient data management concepts to the managerial class, though they
did at least address the ostensible subject of the seminar. Other than
that, it was all about identifying BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
and drawing up matrixes showing which Business Procedure corresponded
with which Business Objective, enlivened only by the odd bloomer ("Is
the company properly organised to meet its informational
requirements?"), three times over. The other three speakers were
marginally more interesting. Roger Tagg (a fellow DBAWG person)
discussed how disparate the elements of an integrated system would
have to be, to include elements such as 'confravision', 'colour
graphics' and what the French call 'bureautique' (i.e. office
Automation). His type of systems analysis, he clearly opined, was more
than equal to the task, if the software wasn't. The second interloper
was Ed Tozer (a fellow DMUG person) who did a reasonable job of
plotting the available software along such unfamiliar axes as 'type of
user' (management/specialist/clerical) and 'type of query' (high/low
volume, un/structured, ad hoc...). He also asserted that within a few
years we would all have a mip on our desks, if not in our pockets. The
third interloper, a fellow academic from Newcastle, was similarly
apocalyptic about various new types of chip, expert systems, join
machines etc. The day was not however a complete waste of time:
over the (also awful) lunch I met the newly appointed head of ICL's
IDMS design team and impressed on her our distaste for being compelled
to use DDS, requirements for Fortran etc. etc. </p>
