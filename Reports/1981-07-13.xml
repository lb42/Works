   <head type="event">British National
Conference on Databases</head>
   <p>This was the first national
conference on databases ever held. It was jointly organised by the
BCS, Aberdeen University, Middlesex Polytechnic and Cambridge
University, with money from IBM, and drew an unexpectedly large
attendance of nearly 150, with equal numbers of delegates from both
industry and academia. The standard of presentations,(with one or two
exceptions) and of discussion was unusually high</p>
   <p>for such
encounters and I was able to continue discussions with
some</p>
   <p>delegates I had previously met in Cardiff at the rather
less high-powered gathering I attended there last week. Another
unusual feature of the conference was that all the papers given had
been submitted in full in advance, and copies of the proceedings were
thus made available before they occurred. (My copy is available for
consultation). </p>
   <p>Of the 11 papers presented, Deen gives a very
useful summary of the state of the art in database research, at least
as viewed from Aberdeen - which is probably a pretty good place to
view it from; Zahran (LSE) proposes some less than revolutionary
methods of extending the capability of Data Dictionary systems; Brown
et al (id) give another glimmer of the long-awaited pot of gold which
is ICL's RADS - an automatic program generator driven by the Data
Dictionary. (I rather enjoyed this because I've never seen
Jackson-structures actually being used for anything, but the computer
scientists in the audience seemed rather restless. ) Gray (Aberdeen)
continued his promotion of ASTRID, concentrating here on the GROUP-BY
operator with which he claims to have completed the relational
algebra. This was quite impressive, and it is probable that he will be
coming to Oxford to test it on some of our databases in the near
future. Tagg (independent consultant) gave a rather dull precis of the
BCS's even duller report on query languages - dull because it leaves
out all recent developments. Longstaff et al (Open U)
described</p>
   <p>their teaching system which translates queries from
relational calculus back</p>
   <p>into a restricted set of English or
other natural language so that the user may check to see whether he
has asked what he intended to ask, and also to teach by example the
more obscure niceties of the calculus. Crowe et, al (Thames Poly)
describe a similarly motivated system of infinitely less
sophistication. Gray (Cambridge) outlines some of the problems of
dealing with imprecise or unknown values in a database, using three
valued logic, and lattice theory ; Clauert et al (Cambridge) describe
their implementation of a CODD database distributed across several
mini computers (This was amazingly complicated like most Cambridge
procedures but apparently quite effective). Ho (Hong Kong)'s account
of optimal search sequence, i.e. an algorithm for determining how
different file organisations should be ranked when evaluating a query
which will use several files was both inscrutable and, when
understood, redundant. Finally Martin (Liverpool) presented the
results of comparing one dead DBMS (Robot), one still born (RDBMS) ,
one adolescent (RAPPORT) and one real one (IDMS). Chief result was
that Rapport queries wenre easier to write than Cobol DML programs
…. varied immensely, with IDMS usually coming out on
top.</p>
