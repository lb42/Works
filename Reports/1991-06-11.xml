Social History: the challenge of Technology
</head>
   <head type="location">University of Essex</head>

   <p>The University of Essex hosted an interesting one day workshop
with the title `Social History: the challenge of Technology' on
June 1st. It adopted a format new to me, in which ten invited
speakers were allowed a maximum of five minutes to highlight key
issues in their previously-circulated papers, followed by a a 15
minute commentary on each pair of papers by an invited
`discussant' and a general discussion. The programme was
carefully arranged to include five complementary pairs of papers,
and the whole affair proved remarkably successful in generating a
fruitful and stimulating exchange of views amongst the hand-
picked participants, most of whom were computing historians, data
archivists or similar.
</p>
   <p>The first session dealt with the creation of `public use data
sets' with two speakers (Steven Ruggles from Minnesota and Liam
Kennedy from Queens, Belfast) presenting basically similar
projects in the integration and harmonisation of large scale
existing data sets for re-use, in Ruggles' case derived from US
census data over a large number of years; in Kennedy's a whole
spectrum of 19th century Irish statistical data. Both called
attention to the very practical difficulties of harmonising the
differing analytic preconceptions of the original data
collectors, while stressing the need to make the datasets (which
Ruggles described as a `national treasure') more accessible and
user friendly. Prof Michael Anderson (Edinburgh) in commenting,
made several practical points from the ESRC viewpoint, which he
characterised as sceptical about the usefulness of secondary
analyses. He stressed the need to set realistic and achievable
targets as well as the importance of making explicit the
theoretical basis for combining datasets, the need for long term
institutional support and the difficulties of making such data
sets user-accessible for casual enquiry. The discussion indicated
wide support for these concerns, though Ruggles stoutly defended
the general usefulness of public use datasets in social science,
claiming that in the few cases where available they were the most
widely used resources. Several of the historians present
expressed anxiety about the difficulty of linking datasets using
different `codebooks'. Kennedy noted the `spurious consistency'
of terminology such as `general labour' in occupational
classifications; Bob Morris (Edinburgh) pointed out that this
variability reflected important historical differences; Dan
Greenstein (Glasgow) noting that historical sources provided an
`opaque window onto the past' as well as being objects of
interest in their own right, stressed the need for explicit data
modelling of the researcher's interpretations of them.  It
occurred to me that many of these problems were strikingly
similar to those faced by linguists trying to unify different
linguistic annotation schemes and might therefore benefit from
the kind of approaches currently being discussed within TEI AI1.
</p>
   <p>The second session dealt with the need for standardisation in
data collection and interchange. My paper gave a brief summary of
the TEI, stressing its attempts to avoid prescriptivism, and
promising great things for SGML as a powerful notation system.
Manfred Thaller (Gottingen) distinguished four levels of
description appropriate to historical material: numerical data,
factual data, running text and bit-mapped images. Interpretation
differed at each level but all had a common core of problems. He
shrewdly observed that standardisation was becoming more
difficult as researchers tended to define themselves by a
particular technology. A successful standard must be descriptive,
based on a conceptual analysis rather than any technology, but
could only succeed if it was backed up by well-designed and
acceptable technology. Responding, Peter Denley (Westfield)
stressed that standardisation was not a mere abstraction, and
deplored the lack of recognition given in research culture
to collaborative effort. While the TEI's proposals needed to be
made more accessible to the non-professional, there was a danger
that computing historians were about to propose a `third pope' if
they continued to ignore the very real and highly relevant
progress made by other research communities, while their datasets
would be increasingly marginalised. This view seemed to have
general acceptance, though some, notably Anderson, insisted that
quick and dirty methods would always prevail in the long run.
</p>
   <p>The third session dealt specifically with the role of data
archives in historical research, with papers from Paul de
Guchteneire (Steinmetz Archive, Amsterdam) and Hans-Jorgen Marker
(Danish Data Archive, Odense) and a particularly useful synthesis
of them from Bridget Winstanley (ESRC Archive, Essex). De
Guchteneire remarked on the highly skewed usage distribution of
archived material (very small numbers of items being used very
frequently), the archives' reluctance, through lack of resources,
to provide ancillary support facilities, the need to preserve
data sets currently being produced by government and other
agencies, and on the need to formalise citation of datasets.
Marker, picking up Thaller's four-fold characterisation of
historical datasets, agreed that most archives were really only
capable of dealing with survey type material, and that their
methods might not be generalisable. Winstanley reiterated the
need for standardisation in citing and cataloguing datasets;
addressing the palpable discomfort of historians for the social
science model of archiving, she stressed the need for proper
bibliographic description and control. In the ensuing discussion,
I drew attention to the TEI's recommendations for bibliographic
description, and noted the interesting contradiction between an
archive's dual role as repository (foregrounding idiosyncrasy)
and as source of reusable resources (foregrounding integration).
Anderson made the good point that traditional social science
archives were about to be engulfed with the results of
`qualitative' surveys which could mean a narrowing of the
distinction between textual and numeric data.
</p>
   <p>In the fourth session, dealing with the use and potential of
online historical databases, Humphrey Southall (QMW) described
the trials and tribulations of providing JANET-wide access to a
large Ingres database of information  about local labour markets
via a Hypercard-based front-end and Heiko Tjalsma (Leiden) a
project called Chronos which provides integrated access to a
variety of SAS datasets and their documentation. Both talks
tended to concentrate overmuch on the technical details of
networking, which also dominated the discussion. The rapporteur,
Don Spaeth (Glasgow) contrasted traditional mainframe-based
online services with the workstation model, the provision of
networked access to CD-ROMs etc. and the discussion tended to
drift into rather ill-informed speculation about likely
technological changes, though Eric Tannenbaum (Essex) (who was
unfortunately present only for this session) did make the
interesting observation that it would be the need of
environmental and other researchers for terabytes of data within
seconds which would determine the likely development of new
networks.
</p>
   <p>The last session of the day dealt with the topic of IT in the
teaching of history. Frank Colson (Southampton) gave an
optimistic acount, based on the impressive success record of his
HIDES system, which is designed to complement rather than replace
traditional library resources. Deian Hopkin (Aberystwyth) was
less sanguine: his analysis concentrated on the impossibility of
funding new IT-based teaching methods without proper
institutional and financial support. As Rick Trainor (Glasgow)
pointed out, the papers were nicely complementary, in that the
teaching methods described by one were precisely those which
present funding arrangements made it difficult or impossible to
provide. Hides had been justly praised for the way it enhanced
the traditional teaching role by providing students with the
opportunity to carry out systematic analysis of major problems,
on their own terms, while the National Curriculum appeared to
wish to undermine or undervalue that very potential by using IT
as a low-cost way of providing transferable skills. Computer-
based teaching was an effective way of bringing a closer
rapprochement between teaching and research as well as in
breaking artificial discipline-based distinctions. He felt that
it was better to focus on the institutional problems preventing
its wider acceptance than on the purely technological ones, and
that the methodological differences between social science and
history had been overstated.
</p>
   <p>In the following discussion, Morris probably spoke for several
when expressing disquiet at the way the morning's discussions of
the technical possibilities and the intellectual challenge that
they posed seemed to have gone adrift. He feared that
technophoria would distract from the fact that only some models
of enquiry were well served by IT. For Hopkin, IT was of
importance because it enforced a `confrontation with the data'
and reminded historians of the need for a methodology to handle
that confrontation. Greenstein agreed on the crucial importance
of a formalised model of enquiry (for which he gracefully gave
credit to the TEI), and noted that without one teaching history
(as opposed to transferable skills which could be got anywhere)
was very difficult indeed. Spaeth remarked that revolutionary
fervour had been the downfall of the quantifying school of
historians and agreed that the misuse of IT for its own sake lead
to poor teaching practice.
</p>
   <p>I came away very favourably impressed by the format of the day:
tightly-focussed small group discussions can sometimes be a
little incestuous, but the programme had been carefully arranged
to provoke ample scope for controversy and some fruitful argument
had ensued. From the TEI perspective, I was particularly
encouraged by the evident willingness of the computing historians
to confront standardisation problems at the heart of the TEI
agenda, and to restate them in their own terms.
