   <p>This was a very useful meeting at which I learned a
good deal about ICL's current planning, relating to both the role of
CAFS and its software interface. I also obtained some (probably
company confidential) dates. To summarise, CAFS is seen as an integral
part of the hardware, not an optional bolt-on; there was also talk of
the 'File Correlation Unit' or 'Join Machine'. All data management
software (which is, after all, what sells ICL mainframes) will
interface to CAFS by 1984, either directly (PDS, QRYM, IDMS), via the
new 'Relational Programming Package' (or RPP, on which see below) or
via 'Predefined Set Access Method' (PSAM, on which see below). RPP is
used by Cobol programs (through a call interface, and a preprocessor
similar to that currently used by IDMS) while PSAM sits between an
existing object program (e.g. a package) and a conventional file on
CAFS. In all three cases definitions of some sort need to be present
in the Data Dictionary, (even for PDS!) mapping the 'relational view'
in terms of which queries are always expressed (RPP/PDS/QRYM are
'single sourced') on to the data item/s in the file/s being
accessed. This mapping may be quite simple (e.g. a few fields of a
record in a RECMAN file) or very complex (e.g. a specified navigation
through an IDMS database); some automatic path choosing is present in
RPP but should probably be treated with great caution. This
integration of query languages has one great benefit (quite apart from
its use of CAFS) in that it provides a simple (and relational)
interface to IDMS; its major defect is that separate mappings must be
generated for each combination of fields constituting a 'relational
view' and stored in the Dictionary. This is then used to generate an
OMF module (functionally similar to an IDMS object subschema) used at
runtime together with the RPP inline code and the user program. Each
query must be precompiled in this way, (unless QRYM is in use) but may
be parameterised to some extent. In those parts of the query where a
literal would normally appear, a parameter identifier may be supplied,
and then instantiated at runtime. The mechanism for passing parameters
through the PSAM interface is not yet defined, but is thought to be
via SCL: the PSAM interfaces is clearly of great interest to us, but
equally clearly still the subject of internal discussion within
ICL.</p>
