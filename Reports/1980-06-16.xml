   <head type="location"> Klett, Stuttgart </head>

   <p>Klett is one of Germany's leading
publishers, particularily of school text books and dictionaries. I was
invited to visit them to discuss methods of analysing machine-readable
dictionaries with their computing consultant, G.Lieser. Klett had
previously obtained a copy of the Hornby OALDCE transcript from the
Archive, and much of my time in Stuttgart was spent discussing the
problems of 'parsing' entries in this dictionary by computer, in order
to extract all the subfields while still retaining the ability to
reconstitute the original entry. I was able to offer Klett a copy of
the new Collins dictionary(which poses similar but different problems)
in return for their hospitality and also for a copy of the so-called
WEBMARC format transcript of Webster's 7th - a dictionary we have been
trying with little success to obtain from the publishers for two or
three years. Having defined a suitable data structure for dictionary
entries, Klett1s objective is to merge entries from different
dictionaries in order to build up an authoritative lexicographical
database against which new bilingual dictionaries might be
validated.</p>
   <p>Klett is also active in the field of computer
typesetting; their equipment (a Digiset) is driven by the
German-written DOSY-system, which appears to offer a (fairly)
user-friendly interface similar to that proposed for the
Lasercomp. One difference is that the Digiset allows for point-size to
be selected independently (within certain ranges) of font, so that the
number of fonts stored is smaller. Using this equipment and special
software written by Lieser, Klett have produced very high quality
Arabic output. Their mainframe is an IBM 370, running ynder DOS (?),
which has very little flexibility (l was told that only VSAM files
were supported), but they also have a DELTA system supporting about 50
interactive terminals , and an antiquated Philips machine doing the
payroll. They also have an under-utilised OCR which reads only OCR
typefaces.</p>
   <p>I also spent a day at nearby Tubingen where I was
able to visit Dr W.Ott who provides at the Computing Service of the
University of Tubingen a service very similar to that provided by
Susan here at Oxford. Two things particularly impressed me at
Tubingen: the first was the recently published concordance to the
Vulgate. This was produced entirely at the Computing Centre using
Ott's programs to generate the concordance and format it for direct
input to Klett's digiset. The resulting plates were sold at commercial
rates to the publishers by a holding company called Pagina (which also
publishes the new journal Data Verarbeitung). The concordance is being
sold at an astounding DM700 per each of' five vols; Ott told me
estimated the production cost of each volume at 30 marks. The second
impressive thing I saw at Tubingen was a 17 year old CDC machine (due
for retirement next year) which takes up about as much space as the
average German tram and is full of spaghetti, but still supports the
computing requirement of one of Germany's larger universities, with
over 95% serviceability.</p>
