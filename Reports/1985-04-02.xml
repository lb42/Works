   <head type="event">Workshop on
Computers and Art History L. Burnard</head>
   <p>This workshop, organised
by Will Vaughan of the UCL Art History Dept naturally consisted almost
entirely of art historians; notable exceptions being Dave Guppy (UCL
Computer centre), Kevin Flude (from the V &amp; A), the ubiquitous May
Katzen and myself. Most of the art historians were from institutions
in London, but a token Pole, a token Norwegian, two Americans and an
Italian were also in evidence, presumably left over from the
international conference of art historians which finished the week
before.</p>
   <p>The day began with Tim Benton (OU) describing how he had
gone about indexing the collection of Le Corbusier's drawings in
Paris. If he'd confined himself to the problems of data analysis in
this, (he wanted to do things like indexing individual bits of
drawings, distinguishing components of identifiable buildings, drafts,
doodles etc) this would have been more interesting. Unfortunately he
had been primed to present the case for using a mainframe, in his case
at Cambridge, and therefore tried to persuade us that everything could
be achieved using an editor and a sort package. He was followed by
Mike Greenhalgh (Leicester) who, primed to say how wonderful micros
were (in his case running dbase2), completely flummoxed most of the
audience with talk of bit mapped screens and unix interfaces. He also
seemed to judge all mainframes by UMRCC, which seemed a bit
unfair. Amongst products he plugged were a text editor called VEDIT,
the Leicester VT100 simulation chip for the BBC micro, a mark up
language called ASPIC and -yes- the OUCS Lasercomp service. I tried to
redress the balance by giving a much abbreviated version of the
presentation I used for the Ashmolean last year on data analysis,
which was quite well received. Will Vaughan (UCL) argued the case for
doing your own programming by showing how he had managed to re-invent
a reasonable data entry package and (rather more entertainingly)
demonstrated a program running on a BBC micro which would draw
Mondriaans for you.</p>
   <p>Over lunch (which we had to buy for
ourselves, shame), I did my best to persuade K.Flude that the V&amp;A
should consider CAFS a bit more carefully: he turns out to have been
badly bitten by IDMS when an impressionable student at the Museum of
London. After lunch, Cathy Gordon (Witt Library, Courtauld) described
the impressive database system they are now using to catalogue their
collection of reproductions. This had several interesting features I
intend to pirate for the Ashmolean, notably full support for divergent
interpretations of the various pictures and a very natty hierarchic
system of encoding iconography. The software is a customised
unix-based package running on something called a Plexis P25. It was
particularly reassuring to see entities we have included in the
Ashmolean model (such as object-events) reappearing in their
design. Lindy Grant from the Conway library of the Courtauld gave a
presentation which, although rich in illustration, had very little to
say about computers, other than to manifest complete distrust in their
capability to cope with the complexity of architectural description. I
have never seen quite so many photos of Chartres Cathedral in one day
though.</p>

   <p>Kevin Flude (V&amp;A)
summarised the current state of play in the computation of national
museums in an appropriately gloomy monotone: nearly everyone uses what
the MDA offers, which is basically batch runs of GOS to produce your
catalogue: no museum has the money or the expertise to develop new
interactive systems and no package currently available seems
suitable. Finally, Rob Dixon from Erros computing gave a sales pitch
for (and demo of) a package called STIPPLE (System for Tabulating and
Indexing People, Posessions Limnings and Ephemera). This package runs
on an IBM System 38, and thus can afford to be lavish in its use of
B-tree indexing, which appears to be its main novelty. Its interfaces,
despite Mr Dixon's assurances to the contrary, seemed rather obscure
to me, and at present you can only use it by leasing a line to Erros
Computing's machine in Abingdon. The Tate Gallery has apparently
fallen for it, but no one else, as yet.</p>
   <p>The Workshop continued
for a second day, devoted to small group discussions on various
topics; although I was unable to participate in these, the feedback
during the papers on this day was quite encouraging: the art
historical world is ripe for computerisation.</p>
