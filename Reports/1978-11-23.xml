   <head type="event"> ICL IDMS User Group Meeting
</head>
   <head type="location">Polytechnic of Central London</head>
   <head type="when">23 Nov
78</head>
   <p>This was the first meeting of the main group since I
joined its executive. About 50 to 60 people were present, representing
some forty different organisations, the large majority being
commercial or government installations. The minutes, including a list
of attendees, will be available when I get my copy.</p>
   <p>The main
business of the meeting was to discuss the proposed changes in the
Group's structure and the change in its name. It was agreed that the
group should now be known as the Data Management User Group or DMUG. I
gave a (necessarily) brief outline of the activities of the Fortran
sub group, and was subsequently approached by two possible future
users of the Fortran inter face (bnoc and WHSmith).</p>
   <p>In the
afternoon, Geoffrey Baker, a consultant for a firm called CACI, gave a
brief outline of a system he had developed for the NERC's Marine
Agency, for collecting and storing scientific data about the sea. The
novel feature of the data scheme was that descriptive elements were
included in the database, giving unusual flexibility. The system was,
effectively, a combined data dictionary and network database. Such a
system might well be of use to some of our users.</p>
