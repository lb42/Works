   <head type="event">Conference on MS encoding</head>
   <head type="location">Studley Priory</head>

   <p>This was a hard working weekend conference, rather on the TEI model,
organized by Peter Robinson of de Montfort University and the <ref target="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/projects/ctp/">Canterbury
Tales Project</ref>, in collaboration with Dr Hope Mayo from the newly Mellon-funded
project on Electronic Access to Manuscripts. It assembled representatives
from several major European manuscript collections, specifically <ref target="http://portico.bl.uk/">the
British Library</ref>; the Arnamagnaean Institute at the University of Copenhagen;
the Institut de Recherche et Histoire des Textes in Paris; the Vatican
Library; the Czech national library in Prague; the Welcome Institute; the
National Library of the Netherlands at the Hague; the Marburg Institute
and the Bodleian, together with experts on MARC, on the <ref target="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/FindingAids/EAD/arlpap.html">Berkeley
Finding Aids project</ref>, the <ref target="http://www-tei.uic.edu/orgs/tei/">Text
Encoding Initiative </ref>and the <ref target="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core">Dublin
Core</ref>. The charmingly-named Merilee Proffitt was also present as a representative of the joint Berkeley-Columbia Digital Scriptorium project.
The object of the two days was to formulate a basis for minimum
level descriptive cataloguing, specirfically of western medieval manuscripts,
and agree a context in which this could be developed, with an eye to future
European funding.</p>

   <p>This was an unusually well-prepared and documented meeting: <ref target="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/wip/studley.txt">brief
bibliographic and biographical details </ref>of all the participants were
circulated before hand, and I came away laden with paper and replete with
technical detail. A full report was promised, so this should be taken only
as a summary stop gap, composed from my personal and probably <ref target="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/bear.html">ursine</ref>
standpoint.</p>

   <p>The first day was taken up by presentations from each of the cataloguing
experts present, recounting their own institutional policies and current
practices, which proved a most instructive mixture. <ref target="http://portico.bl.uk/">At
the BL</ref>, for example, Michelle Brown spends one day a week "up
a ladder" looking for illuminated mss, which when found are given
minimal level descriptive cataloguing "at shelf" using a dtd
developed by Richard Masters, while Rachel Stockdale and her colleagues
are contemplating the horrors of retrospectively converting an estimated
million printed textual descriptions to a structured format. Mathew Driscoll
and Dominik Wujastyk gave good introductions to what was special about
their own kinds of mss (Icelandic and Sanskrit respectively); Elizabeth
Lalou described the latest incarnation of Medium, the medieval ms database
developed at the IRHT in the 70s; we learned a little about the Vatican's
150,000 estimated mss, of which only 15% are catalogued, from Piazzoni,
and also about the thinking behind the <ref target="http://www.nkp.cz/externi/digit/Structure_Proposal/">Czech
National Libary's </ref>Unesco-funded digitization project from Adolf Kroll.
Thomas Brandt described the Marburg Institute's MIDAS system, which underlies
a very impressive publishing programme, and also a very interesting collaborative
cataloguing venture called Diskus, involving several major German museums
and art historical institutions. Anne Korteweg described the cataloguing
scheme used for manuscripts at the<ref target="http://www.konbib.nl/kb/100hoogte/hh-en.html">
Dutch Royal Library</ref>, mentioning in particular its use of PICA and of
Iconclass Finally, Richard Gartner outlined the<ref target="http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/mss/">Bodleian's
mss cataloguing projects</ref>, using EAD and a set of TEI extensions.</p>

   <p>Day two began with some real computer demonstrations from David Cooper,
showing the Bodleian's Celtic manuscript project, and from <ref target="http://www.software.ibm.com/is/dig-lib/">IBM's
digital library</ref> projects, in the shape of Peter Elliott and Uschi Reber.
None of this had a lot to do with the stated business of the meeting, but
it was nice to see some really good digital images (or would have been
had I not been busily getting my own presentation ready). Real business
resumed with three brief technical presentations about MARC (from Larry
Creider), EAD (from Daniel Pitti), the TEI Header
(me), and the Dublin Core as a discovery vehicle (from Jennifer Trant).
The rest of the day was devoted to discussion of what exactly should constitute
a Dublin-style core set of descriptors for manuscript materials. This began
with a rather unsuccessful attempt to get everyone to agree on a top ten
list of fields that must be present, got bogged down somewhat, but eventually
cohered around the notion of identifying a key set of descriptive categories,
within which more specific fields might be mandated. The discussion was
finally given some coherence by a rather neat taxonomy proposed by Jennifer
Trant, which I reproduce below. Starred items indicate those which were
agreed on as essential, according to my notes.</p>

         </list>
      </item>
   </list>

   <p>A fuller and clearer version of this list is to be produced in the official
report of the meeting. With this consensus established, the real work of
defining the nitty gritty of how (for example) this consensus might be
mapped on to a MARC record structure or a  TEI header was left to another day. The plan is to prepare a bid for a two year development
project, funded by the EU libraries programme and co-ordinated from de
Montfort, which will define such implementations, systems for producing
such records in technologically-challenged libraries, and a central repository
for them, as well as a detailed set of Guidelines. Watch this space.</p>

   <p>In all honesty, I must add that some credit for the hard thinking and
energetic discussion which characterized this meeting may be due also to
the sybaritic nature of its surroundings. Studley Priory is a beautiful
building, with an excellent chef, a well-stocked bar, and some rather fine
gardens for stomping around in, even on a windy November weekend.</p>
