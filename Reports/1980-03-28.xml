   <head type="event">ALLC 6th International Symposium on
Computers in Literary and Linguistic Research</head>
   <head type="when">28 March â€“ 3 April</head>
   <p>The general quality of work
reported on at this symposium was perhaps slightly more technical and
strictly 'computational' than at some previous ones in the
series. There were noteworthy papers in the usual areas of
lexicography, prosody, bibliography, concordancing, attribution
studies, literary statistics and so forth, but also some sessions on
database techniques, natural language processing and -whisper who
dares- machine translation. The latter was the subject of Professor
Liu Yong-quan from the Peking Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
where machine translation has been somewhat of a necessity and appears
to work (into if not out of Chinese) despite the limitations of
available hardware. Jitze Couperus (CDC &amp; Codasyl)
gave what was intended to be a keynote address on the concurrence of
linguistics and computing in current database trends. Semiotics, he
averred, was more fashionable than cybernetics. No-one disagreed but
(as a subsequent two hour discussion session demonstrated) this may
have been because few understood. This 'Open Forum' was probably the
most disappointing event of the Conferences - the understanding gap
between database specialists and computational humanists shows no
signs of shrinking.</p>
   <p>As an indication of the range of subjects
and representatives at the conference, I shall just mention a few
papers which interested me. Among impressive new textual projects
reported on were the collation of the six editions of Burton's Anatomy
of Melancholy (Faulkner, Washington State); the indexing of two early
17th century German newspapers by topic (Ries, Cambridge); the
production of a lemmatised concordance to Ibsen (Hofland, Bergen) and
the problems of concording the textually complex 1606 folio of Ben
Jonson (Howard-Hill, South Carolina). There was of course a paper on
OCP (Hockey, Oxford) and another on a very quick and very dirty
indexing program called CODOC (Niblett, Swansea) . There was little
else on software of note though there was much informal praise for
SPIRES, UNIX and other unattainable goodies. The most impressive
hardware on view was that attached to the Chinese Languages
Transposition Project (Nancarrow, Cambridge) which hooks a tektronix
up to a rotating cylinder for transput of any of several thousand
characters in Chinese, Tibetan etc. Among more technical papers,
Cercone (British Columbia) surveyed current methods of storing
lexicons for natural language applications and Skolnik (Amsterdam)
gave a good account of storage mechanisms well suited to them. Another
new statistical measure of lexical diversity was proposed by Delcourt
Mathonet &amp; Mersh (Liege) and the poetic style of W. B.Yeats
resisted all attempts to analyse its variations with EYEBALL (Jaynes,
Minnesota). Not so Dostoevski, who has now come under the searching
eyes of Geir Kjetsaa (Oslo) and his attribution
algorithms.</p>
   <p>Abstracts of all the papers are available from
me. Apart from the papers I can report a great deal of interest in OCP
and a great deal of information about machine readable texts scattered
around the globe. I was co-opted to an international working party
which aims to catalogue all such materials. Finally there was an
Elizabethan Feast, complete with madrigals, which almost (but not
quite) made up for the appalling standards of the Newnham
cuisine.</p>
