   <head type="event">ICL DMUG/ End User Facilities Sub Group (79) Second
Meeting</head>
   <p>This Sub Group has recently reconstituted itself to
investigate primarily the sort of conceptual view end users
should/would like to have of databases supported by ICL software. The
meeting was well attended (about 25 people from organisations such as
BBC, Post Office, CAA, Plesseys, Sainsburys, West Midland Gas, an
Insurance Company, Oxfordshire County Council and the Ministry of
Defence in various forms.</p>
   <p>The terms of reference proposed at the
last meeting were discussed and a rewording which removed some
wooliness from the original draft agreed. Some discussion of Data
Display (the query facility currently supplied for IDMS) indicated
that it would not fall within the province of this group but rather
within that of the IDMS group.</p>
   <p>Harry Ellis responded on behalf
of ICL to the terms of reference, thus giving some weight to the
proceedings.</p>
   <p>After lunch it was agreed to begin by considering
existing types of conceptual view (relational, binary, hierarchic
&amp;c), in particular the interfaces proposed by recent articles in
the literature fo between a relational conceptual view and an IDMS
structured internal view. Links between IDMS and other pieces of
software (STATS, FAME &amp;c) were also suggested as possible areas
for exploration. This seemed a more profitable starting point that the
description of yet another all purpose query language, parameters for
which had already been defined by the last EUFSG. A part of MOD called
OECON (theyfight phantasy wars for NATO) had a document on the setting
up of such a query language which might be made available to the
group; so had CAA produced a report.</p>
   <p>The most interesting
revelation of the day was that ICL are 'productizing' (Mr Ellis's
word) the relational database system RDBMS designed by Andrew Hutt at
Southampton and implemented experimentally on their 1900 some time
ago. Whether this would be a stand-alone product (linked into the DDS
of necessity but discrete from IDMS) or whether it could be made to
'front-end' onto (existing?) IDMS databases was not yet clear. ICL
were aware of the requirements Universities and others had for
simplicity of access to databases, and appeared to think that the
relational view was the answer. If this is the line taken, most if not
all, of the problems currently being experienced with IDMS usability
(4 month learning process etc.) should disappear. The relational view
is also (unlike the Codasyl structures) academically respectable. The
work of this subgroup as a pressure group on ICL seems to me to be
very important, and its effects may be far-reaching.</p>
