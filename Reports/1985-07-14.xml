   <head type="event">International Workshop on the Creation Linkage and Usage
of large-scale interdisciplinary sourcebanks in the historical
disciplines</head>
   <p>This four day workshop (the title of which was
even more impressive in German) had of necessity a floating
population, but over the whole period there were some notable absences
(e.g the French) as well as some unexpected presences (i.e the
Italians en masse). Attendance averaged thirty each day, predominantly
German and Austrian, with a sprinkling of Swiss, four Italians (two
each from Pisa and Rome), one American (namely Jarausch of North
Carolina, president of the International Something for Quantitative
Historical Research), one Belgian (Paul Tombeur from Cetedoc,
Louvain), one Dane (Marker, from the Danish Data Archives) and three
Britons (May Katzen from Leicester, Kevin Schurer from Cambridge and
myself).</p>
   <p>The stated purpose of the Workshop (or, as Zampolli
persisted in calling it, Washup) was to investigate the feasibility of
standardising the machine-readable sources increasingly used by
historians and to promote their free exchange on a European basis. Its
unstated purpose (according to Tombeur who, as sole representative of
the Francophone world, was in a somewhat machiavellian mood) was to
consolidate its organiser's position as a newly-appointed mere
Austrian in the pecking order of Germanic scholarship. Certainly there
was much wheeling and dealing going on, mostly in German, and it was
evident that quite significant gestures in the direction of European
co-operation were being made. Either way, I found it an unexpectedly
worthwhile and unusual gathering: worthwhile in that a formal
agreement between the three Text Archives represented was actually
committed to paper, and that I found out about several database
projects not at all unlike our own previously unknown to me; unusual
in that the informal structure and small scale of the occasion
permitted quite detailed discussion.</p>
   <p>The main achievement of the
Workshop was probably the agreement between Zampolli, Tombeur and
myself reached over lunch on the first day. This had four heads: to
combine our Archive catalogues, to continue to control access to their
contents in the same way (effectively) as we currently do at Oxford,
to try to get legal guidance on the copyright problems involved and to
investigate ways of standardising descriptions of text formats. A
proposal will be put to a subcommittee of the Council of Europe
chaired by Zampolli for MONEY to work in this area. This agreement was
achieved largely in reaction to a proposal made by Manfred Thaller
(the workshop's organiser) which we all agreed was unworkable for
text, with all its attendant copyright problems, however desirable it
might be for unpublished historical sources. Regrettably, the only
person who might have been able to introduce some intellectual
stiffening to the discussion of text formats (van der Steen, whose
paper on text grammars presented at ICCH this year was also to be
presented here) was unable to attend, as were representatives of the
major French and German text archive.</p>
   <p>During two days of rather
circular argument, it beame apparent that the nation of conceptual
analysis as a necessary precursor of database design is still widely
regarded with suspicion by historians, being seen as the preserve of
informatics. For many of those present the phrase data description was
assumed to be something more like the proposed 'Study Descriptions'
which the Social Science Survey Archives (coincidentally meeting at
the same time in Esssex) have been trying for some time to
standardise. In my innocence, I made the point (several times) that
computer held versions of original source materials need some rather
more abstract description than are needed for derived sets of numbers
and standardised encodings. The OUCS database design course, part 1,
might have been of some assistance here, but I was not called upon to
give it; instead 1 gave a condensed version of my Nice paper,
stressing how the TOMES database resembled its abstract model. I also
found myself chairing a most unsatisfactory discussion on how texts
should be described, for my sins.</p>
   <p>Most of the presentations were
given in German, with rather haphazard summary translation. What
follows should therefore be regarded not as an exhaustive account, but
just as a crystallisation of the bits I could (a) understand (b)
remember.</p>
   <p>Much of one day was given over to a presentation by
teams from Freiburg and Munster of a massive database of Mediaeval
German names extracted from necrologies, abbey roll calls etc This
proved to be the Greek Lexicon writ large (they have about 400,000
name forms and the database occupies 230 Mb.); one could unkindly say
that its software is also pretty Mediaeval: they use Sperry's DMB-1100
which is a Codasyl system, but access to the database is provided only
by a query language which looks very much like Data Display, circa
1975. The part of it of which they were proudest was the vastly
complicated lemmatisation code which determines what the probable root
form of a name is if the particular variant of it required is not yet
in the database. They promised to send me a copy of their schema
design in which they have somehow managed to find a need for about 40
different record types to support a subset of the facilities the Greek
Lexicon supports with less than a dozen.</p>
   <p>A team from Zurich
described an interesting, if methodologically suspect, project in
which vast amounts of data about the weather in Switzerland between
1525 and i860 had been extracted from all sorts of written sources and
then combined to produce all sorts of time series analyses about
changes in agriculture, social structures etc. A gentleman from
Salzburg described his attempts to analyse patterns of Mediaeval
migration using Thaller's own CLIO system, unfortunately entirely in
German. CLIO was also the subject of a presentation, though not a very
clear one. It is a PL/1 package, currently being rewritten in C, a
novel feature of which is its string pre-processor, which converts
from more or less any input format likely to be encountered in "free
text" versions of parish records, chronicles etc down to its own
internal structures, access to which is then provided by an
interactive concordance generator. Various other software tools
(e.g. to do nominal record linkage and lemmatisation) are also
provided, but Thaller did not have time to do more than sketch the
architecture of the system.</p>
   <p>I was more impressed by a man called
Merqenthaler from Ulm, who has wrapped up SIR/DBMS, TEXTPACK, COCOA, a
word processor, the standard SIEMENS archival system and possibly some
other bits and pieces into one consistent screen driven package, -for
use by psychiatrists doing content analysis on transcripts of patient
interviews. The raw text is put through a spelling checker as well as
a dictionary which identifies key (psychological) concepts within
it. His system is also being rewritten in C, which appears to be where
it's at in Germany these days.</p>
   <p>I was also impressed by two of
the art historians present who did not actually give presentations but
with whom I had some interesting discussions about the Ashmolean
project; one was from the Marburg institute, whose work with Iconclass
I already knew of; the other was Dr Albert Schug from Cologne, who
appeared to be the Grand Old Man of museum applications in
Germany.</p>
   <p>Finally, I met two archaelogists with something
intelligent to say (not a very common occurence). One was selling a
natty little micro-based system called ARCOS which records sherd
images on videotape and then automatically analyses them to provided
cataloguing data; the other was selling a detailed descriptive
taxonomy for archaelogical specimens. The former costs 60,000 DM and I
have an English language glossy about it; the latter is free, but all
in German.</p>
