   <p rend="it">At the end of April 99, I spent a week in Granada courtesy of
the <ref target="http://www.gca.org">GCA</ref>, where I attended the
      <ref target="www.gca.org/conf/euro99/">XML Europe 99 conference</ref>. The
price of this privilege was that I had to pay attention during all the
sessions, and then give a closing address at the end of the
conference, after a very sybaritic lunch (see below).  </p>
   <p>I duly attended, and
took assiduous notes, (and then lost them all which is why I don't
have a visit report to post). I gave my closing plenary from a series
of bullet points on my laptop, which lead several people to assume
that I had actually prepared a serious talk, and, more seriously, to ask
me for copies of the slides afterwards.
</p>
   <p>I have therefore attempted to confect a more or less plausible
version of what I actually said, written out in my best joined-up
wrote it in XML, using the newly minted XML version of the TEI Lite
DTD, so you should be able to read it with almost anything....
