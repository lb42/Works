<div xml:id="Report-2008-10-08" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" > <head>"They order these things better in France"</head>
  <p>Last week I found myself once more in Paris for a meeting of the
Conseil Scientifique (sounds impressive, means something like
Academic Advisory Committee) of the <ref target="http://www.tge-adonis.fr/">TGE Adonis</ref> which, if you
don't know it, is the major French
infrastructural agency for provision and management of digital
resources in the humanities and social sciences (SHS), one of the
small number of such "tres grand
equipements" funded by the CNRS. Business of the day,
not too strenuous, a review of the minutes of the last meeting,
reports on recent and planned TGE activities, and an opportunity
for us to make annoying comments about how things really ought to
be done, without too much responsibility attached (ADONIS also has
a proper steering committee, which meets next week). More
significantly, perhaps, a chance to get an interesting glimpse of
how this bit of the French academic community is reacting to the
same digital agenda as the rest of us.</p><p>The CS has about ten members, most of them senior academics or
librarians with considerable depth of experience of things digital
and webby: see the (slightly out of date) list . My favourite is
Francoise Genova, who runs the AstronomicalObservatory at
Strasbourg, (one of the best illustrations of what the web and
judicious application of standards can do to transform the way a
discipline operates), but they're all pretty
cool. This meeting welcomed a new member, Alexandre Moatti, a
historian of science and maths with a distinguished track record in
digital library activity.</p><p>As far as I understand things, one of the chief challenges for
ADONIS has been to establish a niche for itself from which to exert
significant influence amongst the rather crowded world of
acronymically-named infrastructural entities in France. It seems to
be succeeding: for example, NUMES which is a joint project with
ABES (the major French academic OPAC) to prepare a catalogue of
digitization projects, is now set to kick off next year, having
been the subject of some uncertainty for the last two. A similar
project for the social sciences is also underway, via the existing
QUETELET portal The ADONIS team (Yannick Maignien and Benoit
Habert) is fortunate in possessing immeasurable amounts of
diplomacy and doggedness, as well as enormous amounts of expertise
and experience: they need them. Sometimes things go wrong: an
attempt to set up an "observatory" on
the take-up and application of digital resources (policies on which
vary enormously across institutions), has apparently been blocked
by inter-ministerial rivalries; but often they go right, as witness
the setting up of a pilot project on archiving of spoken data on
the OAIS model, to be carried out by ADONIS and the CRDO jointly
with the BNF (Bibliotheque Nationale de France), and the DAF
(Direction des Archives de France).</p><p>This year, ADONIS organised a summer school to promote
communication amongst all the projects it had initially funded
which seems to have been a reasonably successful community-building
event (there is a full report on the ADONIS website). One of the
ideas proposed was to set up a quasi-autonomous
"user group" of some kind, which
seemed an interesting way of balancing the lack of any more formal
way of assessing user-need in the community. It does however beg
the question of how representative of the wider SHS community such
a self-selecting group can hope to be. This led to a discussion of
the relationship with the existing "centres de
ressources numeriques" (Digital Resource Centres) .
There are five of these, pecialised for the most part by type of
materials held: CRDO for spoken data (donnees orales); CNRTL for
texts and linguistic data; TELMA for manuscripts and archives;
M2IAS for geographical data; and C2SNV for visual data. The
interesting point about these is that they are all attached to (at
least one) specific institution, have a significant history of
expertise, and are (largely) financially independent. From a UK
perspective, they thus look rather like former AHDS centres, but
without any AHDS Executive, or any top-down funding. By providing a
model for long term archiving, and also for exchange of information
about best practice (another topic which emerged at the summer
school concerned recommendations for tools), it seems that ADONIS
provides something to complement the specialist activities of the
Centres in a useful way.</p><p>ADONIS has also been working as a marriage broker, it appears:
the world of online journals is a nightmare one for French
librarians, dominated by the competing claims of at least two
different cataloguing systems (CLEO and CAIRNS). ADONIS has now
successfully brokered an agreement between these two to make their
respective online catalogues mutually linked, so that a search in
one can find links (based on DOIs) to the other. Even more
amazingly (to me), it appears that someone (at INIST?) is working
on using TEI as a bridge format between some of the various XML
formats currently in use in institutional repositories for e-theses
etc. Hoorah!</p><p>Also like the late-lamented AHDS, ADONIS is charged with
providing something called a
"metaportal"; it has sensibly
contracted implementation of this out to a private company (Atos
Consulting) and the CS was therefore treated to some slides showing
the likely architecture and content of the portal. I whinged on
about how their model didn't include any
provision for archiving (fine, that is being done elsewhere) or for
migration of project to service (this did seem to be something they
had not thought about).</p><p>ADONIS will issue a call for new projects next year; the
intention is to finance a smaller number of larger projects than
last year, typically consortia running two-year projects. I
suggested that it would be useful to hold some kind of town meeting
to help the community develop such consortia in advance of the
bidding process, a suggestion which seemed to go down well.</p><p>After the meeting proper, Yannick asked me to recommend some
relevant UK contacts; I pointed him to arts-humanities.net,
described the emerging Network of Centres, and also gave him some
names of people in JISC to pursue.</p></div>
