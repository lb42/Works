   <head>LOU'S MONTHLY REPORT FOR
OCTOBER</head>
   <head>(including at no extra charge, Lou's Monthly
Reports for August and September)</head>
   <p>Much time has been spent in
connexion with OUP's new edition of Shakespeare. All the Howard-Hill
folio texts have been processed into usable form; the task of proof
reading and adding COCOA references continued throughout this period,
and has now accelerated with the appearance of an editorial assistant
from OUP. Programs to produce the compositorial index were written
ages ago and still seem to be working.</p>
   <p>During August I got
myself into a terrible state preparing a paper for presentation at a
Conference on Database Applications in the Humanities &amp; Social
Sciences to be held after ICCH4 at Dartmouth College. Efforts to get
IDMSX running under 5X32 in order to substantiate the claims in the
paper (which concerned our only IDMSX application) were unsuccessful,
so they (the claims) had to be moderated, but they (the efforts)
continue. ICCH4 was an impressive experience; I heard news of all
sorts of projects likely and unlikely, acquired 3 magtapes of text and
several inches of printed blurb, and met too many people to list
here.</p>
   <p>September began with my getting into a terrible state
tidying up the previous paper for publication (camera ready copy
produced by the Qume was sent off two days before the deadline), and
preparing another, entirely different one, for presentation at the
IUCC Symposium. A report on the symposium will appear in the next
Newsletter. The last two weeks of September I spent on holiday in
Italy, which was ok till the gelati ran out.</p>
   <p>Somehow during this
period, at least two IDMS projects made considerable progress: the
clinical trials database for :RPM is well into testing, and initial
loading of the dictionary database for :BROADBENT seems to be
complete. October saw the start of a new project to hold information
about vascular surgical operations (:KIDSON). I discussed another
possible archaelogical project, but decided it was not worth using
IDMS for. D.Doulton came from Southampton to discuss the ways and
means of supporting IDMS (they plan to do so).</p>
   <p>OXMTREAD has been
rewritten and now has a user hook. Documentation of this and of
OXMTWRITE is still incomplete.</p>
   <p>Texts acquired for the Archive
include complete works of Donne, Marlowe and the Gawayne Poet, major
novels of Woolf, Joyce, Dostoevski, Lessing &amp; Plath, and also the
Lancaster Corpus of British English. We might have Chaucer too, if I
could get round the parity error on the tape. Keats, re-edited to
modern standard and nearly complete, came from Newcastle. About 5
texts of various sorts were issued.</p>
   <p>A new version of 2900
Snobol, with bugs I reported in February reputedly fixed came but has
not yet been tested. Preliminary talks with QMC suggest that they will
be able to implement 2900 SPITBOL later this year.</p>
   <p>I wrote
papers for the IDMS User Group on Restructure, Statistics and Fortran
Interface. Meetings were attended in London and Birmingham. Nothing
much happened at any of them.</p>
   <p>I attended a British Academy
lecture by C.S.Butler who has been analysing Sylvia Plath with a
computer; he gave short plugs for Cocoa, Oxeye &amp;c to a largely
incredulous audience.</p>
   <p>I completed a series of four articles on
Snobol for publication in the ALLC Bulletin.</p>
