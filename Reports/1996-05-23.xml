   <p>At the invitation of Daniel Ridings, I visited the Sprakdata Unit at
Goteborgs University at the beginning of May. This unit, which is
distinct from the Linguistics Dept, was set up originally by Swedish
Acdemician Sture Allen, and is the major lexicographical and NLP
research centre in Sweden. I gave a two hour lecture on the subject of
the British National Corpus, followed by an extended demonstration of
the capabalities of SARA to an audience of about 15 lexicographers and
others, which seemed to be much appreciated. On the second day of my
visit, I gave a boiled-down version of the standard TEI workshop to
students on the second year of the University's Computational
Linguistics course, with an emphasis on the implications of TEI markup
for lexical data, at the invitation of Riding's colleague Pernilla
Danielsson. Danielsson and Ridings are collaborating on a project
called PEDANT, which is an aligned multilingual corpus, using TEI
markup and the toolkit developed by Henry Thomson as part of the
Multext project, which we discussed at some length. I also met Steffan
Larsson and colleagues from the Linguistics Dept at Goteborg, who have
developed their own complex annotation scheme for the markup of a
spoken Swedish corpus, and with whom I discussed the possibility of
converting their markup scheme to TEI conformance. My BNC lecture was
also attended by Gary Ward, a systems programmer from the University
of Vaxjo, which is also attempting to set up a SARA server. With
assistance from technicians at Goteborg, we were able to make
considerable progress in getting the current version working, to the
point where we were able to determine that there really was a bug in
the server  (since fixed by Scotty, I am glad to report).
</p>
   <p>The third day of my visit to Sweden, being Sunday, I spent visiting
the Goteborg museum (splendid collection of late 19th century soft
porn) and getting rained on in various picturesque locations, before
heading to Bergen to participate in an encoding seminar being
organized by the NCCH's Wittgenstein Archive. Part of the reason for
this workshop, it was explained to me, was to prepare local staff and
staff from other Norwegian centres for the forthcoming ALLC
conference; I suspect it was also to field-trial the splendid new
facilities being made available for said conference in Bergen's new
Law Faculty building. Whatever the reason, I very much enjoyed the
opportunity of re-running the boiled-down TEI workshop for the benefit
of an intelligent and alert audience. In the time available, it was
not possible to do a full hands-on session, but I was able to run
through the exercises I had prepared (loading an untagged file into
A/E, tagging it, building a header, exporting it, viewing it with
Panorama, etc.) which seemed to be much appreciated.  After the
seminar, Claus Huitfeldt, Peter Cripps and I discussed somewhat
inconclusively how the TEI/MECS Workshop planned for the start of the
ALLC conference should be organized. I think we decided that we'd do
them in parallel, sort of. I also met Lars Johnsen, the new head of
NCCH, a former corpus linguist turned administrator, as well as old
friends from Bergen. The second day of the workshop was given over to
Allen Renear, from Brown, who gave an intriguing historical overview
of the development of what he called the ontology of texts, from
platonism (as characterized by the Brownian OHCO model) through
liberalism (the view that there are many possible hierarchies) to
anti-realism (the view that text has no reality aside from that
projected onto them). Renear characterized the last as being
"fashionable", which I take to mean "wrong".
</p>
   <p>Committments in Oxford meant that I was regrettably unable to stay for
the remainder of this Workshop, which was to include a discussion of
MECS and how it differed from TEI, so I took the customary large lunch
at Hotel Norge before returning home on Tuesday evening.
</p>
   <p>After two days' frenetic but parochial activity in Oxford, I set off
for Innsbruck, via Munich, in the company of Mike Popham. Our
objective was partly to find out what exactly the NOLA project might
be or might become, and partly to get a little time quietly to discuss
the two other meetings to which I had committed Mike's time this
month. Once arrived in Innsbruck, I developed a streaming cold, not
helped by the rain which had followed me from Goteborg, which
may have somewhat coloured my view of the ensuing meeting.
</p>
   <p>The meeting was organized by Allan Janik, of the Brenner Archiv, and
attended by Heinz Hauffe of the Innsbruck University Library, Donald
Broady of the Royal Institute for Technoloy at Stockholm, Lars Johnsen
from Bergen in addition to Mike and me. Its purpose was to review the
the NOLA proposal for funding under the EU's Libraries Programme,
recasting it in the light of criticisms received so far. There was a
general feeling that much work needed to be done, particularly in
recasting the relationship of the project to the TEI, and in involving
more prominent library activities. I had hoped that the work being
done at the Bodleian in extending the TEI Header to handle manuscript
materials might be of some relevance here, but this remains to be
seen. Mike Popham's excellent minutes (soon to be available from the
NOLA web page at http://???) summarize the chief areas discussed and
the future plans of the group. 
</p>
   <p>Mike and I then spent a very useful day preparing an initial position
paper for the Oxford Text Archive to present at the first Service
Providers Forum meeting of the AHDS, and in discussing Mike's
presentation at the Princeton workshop on Software for the Humanities,
before going our separate ways -- he back to Munich and thence to
Princeton, I into the Tyrol and thence to Munich for 
the SGML96 conference. It continued to rain.
