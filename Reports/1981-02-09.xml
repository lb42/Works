Demonstration</head>
   <p>ICL had arranged a hands-on demonstration of
the new Personal Data System (a relational system developed at
Sputhampton) largely for our benefit; attendees were: R.Stratton,
L.Burnard, S.Hockey (OUCS), S.George (QMC) C.Massey (SWURCC) and
D.Doulton (Southampton).</p>
   <p>There was a preliminary briefing
session on PDS concepts - tables, fields, etc. The system manages to
give a full relational capability without the jargon. It is used
entirely interactively. The user defines one or more tables, which
have names and fixed attributes. Each attribute is defined by name and
value (possible values are integer, decimal, character string, date
and century date) . Checking rules may be specified to validate data
further on input. At present all input is interactive, but plans for
bulk loading of data were murmured about.</p>
   <p>The command syntax is
quite simple to use and, after some initial problems with the computer
(a 2903 pretending to be a 1902) three of us were able to get a
reasonable impression of the system in operation. It seemed flexible
and intelligble to the naive user, in most important respects. We all
were able to create and update tables without difficulty, and to make
some simple enquiries. There was of course no way to investigate the
performance of the machine when more heavily loaded.</p>
   <p>There was
some discussion of facilities we felt to be lacking: chielfy more
sophistication in its handling of character sets, more flexible
sorting options, more sophisticated conditionals and a macro facility
closer to that of Data Display. Compatibility with IDMS was also
mentioned as an important requirement. ICL are not of course in a
position to give any firm dates, or even weak ones, but around the end
of this year it might be worth complaining about the product's
non-availability on VME/B again. Meanwhile, there is an excellent
manual, and the product is running on 2903 and ME29.</p>
