   <p>DBAWG (Database Administrator Working Group) is a
long-established working group of the BCS which is also affiliated to
CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Language - that influential body
to which we owe such delights as Cobol and IDMS). Its membership is
eclectic and disputacious. Many innovations in the database world have
originated in or been subtly moulded by its argumentative members (the
IDMS Fortran Interface and the independent storage schema being two
notable recent examples).</p>
   <p>I was invited to attend this meeting
as an observer. The meeting was hosted by Aberdeen University at the
Burn, a charming country house on the banks of the North Esk (but
unfortunately out of the Salmon-fishing season). Other academic bodies
represented included the Open University, Edinburgh and Sheffield
Poly; manufacturers represented included Philips and Univac; software
house CACI and SCICON were also represented as were users such as John
Brown Engineering and MOD.</p>
   <p>It soon became evident, however, that
the members of the group (25 in all) were present in purely personal
capacities. DBAWG's current projects are the definition of an
architecture to support distributed databases and the extension of
CODASYL systems to include access control; its two current subgroups
reflect this division.</p>
   <p>I sat in on discussions of both subgroups
and also on the major topic of the whole meeting, which was the
proposed ANSI DBCS specification derived from Codasyl. Of the two
subgroups, work on the distributed architecture is well advanced and
most of the time was spend clarifying and optimising the expression of
the group's proposals in a working paper. Work on access control is
less well advanced however: an initial model, based on ISO
'information systems' concepts, has been floundering for the last two
meetings on matters of definition. Quite what an 'action' (to or by
which access is to be controlled) is and at what level of
primitiveness it exists has been the subject of two papers, both now
rejected.</p>
   <p>In discussing the ANSI paper, several worthwhile
criticisms emerged, notably the absence of compound data structures
and of language-dependent facilities at the subschema
level.</p>
