Meeting</head>
   <head type="when">21 April 1980</head>
   <p>ICL gave a
presentation of the next release (DD250) of Data Display which is due
for release this summer. This product now presents a very
user-friendly interface to an IDMS database. There are a few new
features (in particular the ability to constrain selection by boolean
expressions of arbitrary complexity using dummy characters) this they
somewhat grandiosley call "fuzzy-matching"} and an extensive 'HELP'
command) but most of the changes from DD2DO are essentially mopping up
and extending what was half done already. The full facilities now
available for user-defined macros in particular give DD considerable
power and it should prove very useful in simplifying use of IDMS
databases by 'non-programmers'. ICL were also due to give a
presentation on the probable contents of IDMS 300 (the
next</p>
   <p>major release of the base product) but were unable to do do
because of</p>
   <p>internal bickerings. I discovered that there might be
problems making any</p>
   <p>new facilities in the base product
automatically available from Fortran, and complained accordingly,
hopefully to some effect. Over a lengthy liquid lunch I discussed my
ideas for an algol68 interface with delegates from ERCC and QMC ,
among other things. After lunch the group discussed ICL's response to
the shortfalls paper, which was bye and large satisfactory, if
non-committal.</p>
