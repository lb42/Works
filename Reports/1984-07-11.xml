   <p>At this, the
third annual British conference on databases, it appeared that
theoretical issues were begining to predominate, perhaps not
surprisingly in that Computer Science Departments are so dominant in
its organisation This may be no bad thing; there is, so far as I know,
no comparable forum in the UK for informal discussion of database
research</p>
   <p>As is customary, the Proceedings were handed out on the
first day, this time in the form of a real book typeset by CUP from
authors' machine-readable mss. Lasercomp enthusiasts will be pleased
to know that Britain's oldest university press had made a right dog's
breakfast of the job; the production schedule did not apparently allow
for authorial proof reading.</p>
   <p>There were two invited papers, two
panel sessions and five sessions of three papers each. The conference
began ominously with the first of the invited papers, from the
appalling Stephen Todd (IBM) who showed some very nice colour slides
of molecules whilst burbling about the database system he had
"lashed-up" some years back with PRTV He remarked with an air of
surprise that database was "not central to the computational chemist's
perceptions" and completely forgot (till prompted by one P Salotti)
that database search and pattern matching techniques might be of some
use in the business of residue identification The other invited
speaker was the legendary R Kowalski (Imperial) whose account of
Prolog as a database language was thorough and well-presented if not
unfamiliar Todd remarking from the back row that it could all be done
in relational algebra, Kowalski riposted that there was more
expressive power in Prolog's left earlobe than the whole of relational
algebra.</p>
   <p>This exchange was alas, about the only sign of
intellectual debate during the conference; despite much talk of
Controversial Issues, there was little controversy, particularly
during the truly awful Panel Sessions These (one on user interfaces,
one on teaching methods) could have been an opportunity for
stimulating and worthwhile argument if they had been chaired with more
enthusiasm or featured more aggressive or opinionated panellists;
instead they were uniformly bland, self-satisfied and trite.</p>
   <p>The
computer scientists did not have it all to themselves: a few mere
users did speak up, amongst which Tony Wakefield (Bristol Poly)'s
account of the complexities of his IMS training course was the best;
this together with G.Loizou (Birkbeck)'s account of the extra software
tools needed to support Cullinet's IDMS were potent advertising for
ICL's IDMS (which has had all the goodies Loizou's lot have had
painstakingly to write for themselves for the last two
years)</p>
   <p>Most attractive piece of software glimpsed over the
horizon was Paul Feldman (Thames Poly)'s automatic diagrammer for
conceptual models. Most</p>
   <p>currently fashionable theoretical issue
was the usefulness (or not) of the triple and the binary model it
supported as a universal formalism (Roger Johnson (Birkbeck) and
G.Martin (ditto)) Most boring and futile piece of academia was not
quite as hotly contended for as usual at these gatherings: the choice
lay between Flynn (EAnglia) comparing various unmemorable design
methodologies, Thanisch (Greenwich Observatory) on automatic
clustering of attributes by means of embedded dependencies and Laender
(EAnglia again) on a design tool for the definition of user views of
rare inpenetrability.</p>
   <p>Best Dressed Presentation was probably Ron
Cuff (IBM) on a rather eccentric natural language query processor
which allowed the casual user to fill in a menu with bits of vague
waffle and then translated the resulting mess into QBE queries Worst
Dressed Presentation was undoubtedly Anne Zorner (Sheffield Poly) on
the DBAWG's DSDL, which did not get round to its subject matter (the
ingenuity with which the proposed DSDL supports dynamic reorganisation
of a live database) until the last five minutes.</p>
   <p>In the same
session, Jon Kerridge (Sheffield Poly again) presented the DBAWG's
architecture for a distributed database system and Elizabeth Oxborrow
(Kent) presented an outline of progress on the Proteus project, which
is a real live (sort of) functional prototype ddbms Again, sparks
should have flown, but didn't Proteus certainly deserved more time,
but uncharacteristic modesty on the part of the organisers (most of
whom participate in it) appears to have inhibited this </p>
   <p>Work we
have done for P.Gray (Aberdeen) on getting Astrid to work on VME may
however give Oxford the entree to this project later this year
Informally interest was expressed in our experience with CAFS in
various quarters; QMC reported that they had one but hadn't worked out
how to plug it in yet and Lancaster that they were thinking of getting
one Two ICL people (no other manufacturers were present) apologised
for the rotten support we had been getting and blamed RWilmot's axe
for it.</p>
   <p>The conference was housed in what looked like a
converted barracks, but the wine at the conference dinner last until
after midnight.</p>
