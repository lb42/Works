   <head type="event">IUSC Working Party on Free Text
Retrieval</head>
   <p>Membership of this new working party is a little
more broadly based than that of the previous IUSC gesture in this
direction; i.e. in addition to J. Duke (Leeds), D. Lindsey (Aberdeen)
and me, it has Peter Willett (Sheffield), who is a real information
scientist, Colin Edwards (Ag &amp; Food Research Council) and Anne
Ford (Leeds Poly). It is chaired by Richard Bland (Stirling), who is
ESRC representative at IUCC and a recent convert from sociology to
computer science.</p>
   <p>The first meeting necessarily accomplished
little besides delineating an area of interest and possible
activity. The fact that at least one major directory of all software
in this area already existed (unbeknownst to the previous working
party) meant that most of the usual spadework has already been done;
it was agreed that some background reading was needed by all members
before manufacturers should be approached. There was some agreement
for the proposal that a clearer idea of possible application areas for
the software were needed; little for the suggestion that we would do
better to wait on/ contribute to the emergence of text facilities in
SQL-2. It was also agreed that something like the forthcoming INGRES
deal would be highly desirable, if feasible.</p>
   <p>Other tidbits I
picked up:- Leeds have been very happy with their version of Status,
but would still rather have bought Basis. Sheffield obtained ASSASSIN
(which has now been completely re-written and is supposed to be very
good) virtually free. F.N.Tesky, now at Brighton Poly, has developed a
low level software interface to Status. Strathclyde has an Alvey
project looking into text searching hardware.</p>
   <p>It was agreed that
the next meeting would be in London, thank God.</p>
