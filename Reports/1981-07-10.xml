Databases in the Social Sciences</head>
   <p>This SSRC-sponsored workshop
brought together a number of experts from the fields of computer
science and social science who (not surprisingly perhaps) were
mutually rather baffling. The general tone of the encounter was set by
Dr Peter Stocker (East Anglia) for the computer scientists and Stephen
Clark (SSRC Survey Archive) for the social scientists
respectively. Clark evaluated software which existed (the
S.I.R. front-end to SPSS) and did nearly everything anyone might want
nearly all of the time, while Stocker described software which had
existed but failed to please and software that didn't exist yet but
would satisfy just about everyone. Stocker also explained how good
computers were not only as a source of entertainment but also as a
source of income . The reaction to this topical jest (much of the
conversation in the bar hinged on comparisons of letters from the UGC)
having subsided, he proceeded to dole out some rather antique
platitudes on the subject of database systems, relational models, size
and scope thereof etc before finally touching on his latest
fund-raising exercise, a distributed database system. This currently
takes the form of lengthy arguments about some way of interfacing
various relational query process rs to a common target and bears a
strong resemblance to ICL's Data Dictionary philosophy. John Welford
(ERCC) was supposed to be speaking about an application of IDMS to a
complex record-linkage (i.e. parish record) problem, but was rapidly
side-tracked into a rather empty discussion of the usability of
otherwise of Cobol, which managed to raise the hackles of both camps
in his audience, the computer scientists by its matter and the social
ones by its manner. The undisputed star of the workshop was chubby Dr
Tim King from Cambridge whose infamously large and complex database of
parish registers we hope to acquire for the Archive before the whole
project gets the chop this August. His database is accessed by means
of his own home-made relational system CODD and its query language
CHIPS (hem hem); this software is written entirely in BCPL and King
and Jardine were evidently a touch miffed that the SSRC had refused
ipso facto to support the package; several social scientists were also
rather disappointed at this, since his was the only system described
at the workshop which could be said to generate much enthusiasm. (This
enthusiasm was however later dispelled by a remarkably inept
presentation by another user of CODD, Ryan Kemp from UCL, whose talk
was barely visible, scarcely literate and utterly devoid of
intellectual content). A more competent speaker, Ron Cuff from Essex,
now c/o IBM, speculated about future directions in query languages,
spouting out acronyms like a burst water main, but also several useful
references Expert systems, natural language query processors, all are
very nearly with us (the best of the latter was called ROBOT in the
states but is now known as OLE (On Line English- presumably to avoid
confusion with Liverpool's antiquated DBMS rather than to appeal to
the Spanish market). The narrowing of the gap between A.I, systems and
query processors continues to lead to flourishing hybrids (and mutual
mystifications). What the social scientists made of all this I cannot
imagine; probably rather more however than they did of the next
speaker, Dr Peter Gray from Aberdeen, whose ASTRID system is an
automatic program generator for accessing a Codasyl database by means
of the relational algebra. The same system was being developed to
interface Zloof's Query-by-example, which Gray felt typified the query
processor of the future. The social .scientists finally managed to get
in a word when Dr N Gilbert (Surrey) described in heart-rending detail
the extremes to which they had to go in order to translate the
inescapably hierarchically structured datasets derived from the
General HouseholdSurvey into flat SPSS-processable files. This (to my
mind utterly futile) task was being carried out in collaboration with
the Survey Archive at Essex; inevitably some linkages are lost and
others 'as many as possible' are then painfully reinstated by hand. In
later conversation with Dr Gilbert and the Archive's representatives I
argued the case for a database solution to this problem, which may
have some effect.</p>
   <p>The Welsh team, in the person of one Fiddian,
gave a paper on their current fund-raising exercise which has the
ambitious name of SENSE; quite what else it has remains <pb facs="Pages/img438.jpg"/>to be seen. It is apparently something
like CONSISTENT on Multics, or Software Tools on UNIX, or -dare I say
it- VME/B. Quite why the government should be funding the development
of a machine independent operating system is rather beyond me, but
then I may have missed something crucial in Mr Fiddian's
extraordinarily soporific talk. The third day of the conference began
with Mr Kemp on whom I have already trampled, and continued with Dr
Ron Stamper (LSE) who seemed by comparison to come from a different
planet. He described the LEGOL project, an ambitious scheme somewhere
between A.I. and data modelling. Its aim is to provide a
knowledge-base representing (currently) the DHSS bureaucracy, in terms
of the law the Department is supposed to embody rather than the
clerical procedures (which would form the basis of a conventional
computerisation). This was fascinating, and LEGOL does actually work â€“
there is a POP2 interpreter for it at Edinburgh. However I cannot
imagine that the social scientists received much from this talk apart
from the pleasing sensation of having their brains gently squeezed
through a fine sieve. Finally however, Stephen Tagg (Strathclyde) came
trailing clouds of glory to assert the claims of SPSSS as a data
management system (sic). This he actually managed to do remarkably
well, with no dodging of unpleasant truths, no vague platitudes and a
considerable display of knowing How To Get Things Done in the
constraints of the real world.</p>
   <p>Finally despite the flippant tone
of this report, I should say how very useful it was to be able to meet
the people behind the projects of which vague rumour has been reaching
me for some time (e.g. King &amp; Jardine, Stamper, Tannenbaum) and
actually discuss matters of mutual interest and concern.</p>
