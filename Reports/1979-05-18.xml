   <p>Presentations given included: a man
from MOD explaining a little of how they currently support their
requirement for a query language suitable for use by Admirals, Flight
Commanders and such like when playing toy soldiers.</p>
   <p>The current
system apparently uses lots of discrete files, some of which (we were
told with a straight face) were designed 'as long ago as 1812') It
seemed that the similarity of their query language to English was
possible largely because of the limited type of queries the system had
to support. They were thinking of expanding from queries about the
positions of friendly/unfriendly vessels to queries about something
called 'signals' but did not seem to anticipate any problems. As far
as their account of it went, there seemed to be very little syntactic
component in their processor. M R Jackson (ICL) spoke on FOCUS a
highly impressive American software-house package which provides an
interface between just about everything and everything else. Since it
interfaces to IMS and to conventional files as well as IDMS, the data
model used is limited to hierarchies, which makes for some contortions
when handling IDMS databases. Its range of facilities (graphics, stats
etc) was staggering, as was its price. Richard Barker (ICL) gave a
short outline of the new facilities in ICL's own Data Display at the
next release (DD200) (some of which look very nice) to see whether the
group considered DD a suitable base for a query language. No firm
conclusion was reached: despite its nice new facilities, DD is
probably best used as a DML programmers aids.</p>
   <p>After initial
false starts, discussion centred on the type of conceptual view the
EUF should support. It was not clear whether a separate view was
required for the interface between the conceptual view/s and the IDMS
structures: whether we were discussing an hourglass (pace Tim Bourne)
or a pyramid (pace everyone else). Favourite candidate for the
pinnacle (or the waist) is currently the Entity Model already used by
DDS, to no-one's particular surprise; I shall certainly do my best to
push the case of the relational view, preferably binary, at the next
meeting when current work will be summarised/ discussed. Meanwhile ICL
is still committed to marketing RDBMS 'at some stage' but not (it now
appears) as a product integrated with other Data Management
products.</p>
