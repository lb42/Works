   <p>The Report looms ever larger: initial complete draft
is due -for next meeting (one month), typesetting should take up most
of September and the publication date is October 4th. Quite a lot of it
is already on 8801 floppies so we might even make the
deadline.</p>
   <p>Actions from the previous meeting of interest: QM250
wont be able to write to ISAM files. The response to my other paper
(on IDMS/CAFS integration.) was slightly more encouraging: it was
agreed that IDMS could be enhanced to use CAFS far physical scans of a
database, and revealed that the fact that QM didn't want to see them
was the historical reason why the CAFS view of IDMS records
excludes pointers, now described by an ICL spokesperson as
"daft".</p>
   <p>VLSI developments: amongst the (internal ICL) register
of about 20 candidates for inclusion in the next generation of CAFS
engines are : key channel enhancements for context sensitive searching
and variable length embedded dont cares, more key channels, improved
performance from the retrieval unit, more flexible record handling by
the format unit and integration with the file correlation unit, (tho
the latter is subject to a marketing decision). Which of these get in
before the design is fixed in silicon remains to be seen. Target speed
of the new device will be at least 10 Mb/sec, just as a result of
vlsi. At least two years before the prototype appears, of
course.</p>
   <p>The new CAFS microcode, with bugs cleared and a 2OX
speed up, is still only in use on series 39 machines. It ought to work
on a 2966 too, but no-one seems to have tried yet.</p>
   <p>Hugh Devonald
floated some ideas about the future structure of the working party,
its affiliation etc. There was a general feeling that its work would
continue under the umbrella of LSUG, perhaps as one of the new
technical committees to be set up. He also incautiousaly let slip the
fact that the CAFS SIG has Â£1700 in the bank, even allowing for the
estimated costs of the new publication, which led to much speculation
about what wine would best accompany the launch of same.</p>
   <p>The
December CAFS lunch at Cafe Royal will feature one C. Cheetham as ICL
speaker and D. Fairbairn, (currently head of NCC, about to join James
Martin Associates) as guru. Also (of course) OUCS, BCC,
CEGB.</p>
   <p>Before lunch we had a quick demo of the BCC library
enquiry system, via a conveniently placed OPD. This was moderately
impressive: the idea is nice but the use of Bulletin is fairly
unimaginative, and the absence of any keyword searching makes the
system less than usefulYou can only retrieve books by specifying one
or two words in the title; no other fields are CAFS searchableIt also
takes a noticeable minute or two to get any response while it searches
its paltry half million titlesPoor response time was attributed to the
fact that it was school hols as well as lunch time.</p>
   <p>Most of the
day was spent going through more draft sections (about
three).</p>
