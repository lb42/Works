   <p>Because of other commitments (Advisory) I was able to
attend only the first day of this two day meeting in Sperry's palatial
skyscraper just off the North Circular road The following were the
chief points of interest to emerge.</p>
   <list type="ordered">
      <item>DBAWG's visibility within
other BCS database groups was less than perfect, largely because of
its rather different style of operation (i.e the others don't produce
any working papers) and personality (i.e DBAWG has a larger than
average proportion of aggressive smart alecs) It was resolved to speak
nicely to Geoff Baker, who churns out the BCS "Database
Bulletin".</item>
      <item>ANSI X3H2 had rejected DBAWG's proposals to amend the
DBCS standard (so as to include words indicating the advisability of a
DSDL component) by one vote However, it now seemed that a better route
to standardisation would be via the BSI subgroup on database standards
chaired by Bill Olle to ISO TC97/SC5, which had previously been
requested to produce work items in this very area The appropriate ISO
group (WG15) had voted overwhelmingly in favour of DBAWG's detailed
comments on the ANSI standards.</item>
      <item>A paper summarising current
activities on the distributed database standard would be presented at
BNCOD; work in this area was all but finished but plans for
publication were currently held up I rashly offered to lasercomp some
sample pages for them. </item>
      <item>The rest of the day was discussion of
the future work of the group. Everyone agreed that detailed
conments on ANSI's new relational standard had to be discussed,
particularly indicating its compatability (or lack of same) with the
DSDL and DDE standards.  Second joint favourites were work on (a)
integration of other datatypes (text, graphics etc.) into database
systems (b) use of views , which are (I think) what subschemas were
supposed to be but never quite are Other less favourably
received proposals included design and modelling tools, fifth
generation languages, application development facilities, future
technology and our old friend access control After much
discussion and complex vote rigging, it was agreed that the group as a
whole would "go New Datatypes and Views as soon as
possible". In the meantime, a few loose ends remained to be tied
up, which was (I hope) accomplished on the second day of the
meeting.</item>
