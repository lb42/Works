   <head type="event">IUSC Workshop on Non-Numeric
Computing</head>

   <p>The eight talks at this workshop covered a range
of topics in non-numeric computing. Of particular interest to me was
Rod Johnson's (UMIST) lecture which consisted of a history and
overview of machine translation from which I picked up a lot of useful
material for my lectures. Talks by S. G. Pulman (East Anglia) on
Programming Requirements for Computational Linguistics and
C. S. Mellish (Sussex) on PROLOG also showed what would happen to
database query systems in the future.</p>
   <p>The more immediate future
was covered by Lou's entertaining exposition on the new FAMULUS and to
a lesser extent by Dave Lindsey's (Aberdeen) survey of text retrieval
systems. It looks as though we should wait for SIFT from Norway,
which, it is claimed, is still going to be free.</p>
   <p>The talk by
B. Lowndes (Liverpool) on RAPPORT told me enough of what I wanted to
know about the package and rather slowly. Two of her examples were
computer centre applications - it would have been nice to hear more
about some real applications including the Egyptian archaeology one
which she obviously regarded as a very unusual use of
computers.</p>
   <p>The remaining session, which I chaired, was on word
processing/typesetting. Adrian Hock (Leeds) described his mainframe WP
program called LEWPS which was geared very much to Leeds'
documentation format. Its only virtue was that the output from one run
can be used as the input to the next, rather than using separate input
and output files as in ROFF etc.</p>
   <p>Heather Brown's long-awaited
talk on 'Typesetting - the systems and the output devices' turned out
to be more of a sales pitch for laser printers of which she showed
many pictures. The resume of her paper which had been set by TROFF
contained some very peculiar hyphenation.</p>
   <p>She has TEX running on
a PERQ at KENT and the PERQ and their laser printer a Canon LBP-10 are
both on the Cambridge ring. There was very little mention of the
Lasercomp, which I tried to rectify by handing out our
brochures.</p>
