   <head type="event">NSC93: Second Network Services Conference</head>
   <head type="location">Warsaw</head>
   <head type="when">October 1993</head>

   <p>The Network Services Conference is an annual get together organized by
the European Association of Research Networks (EARN, aka the European
end of Bitnet). I was invited to the first NSC, held last year in
Pisa, but was unable to attend; I therefore felt morally bound to
accept the invitation to this year's conference, held last week in
Warsaw.  Poland has recently (in the last six months) become a full
member of EARN and has good connexions with the outside world, though
not, as yet, much of an internal communications infrastructure. For
the duration of this conference however, happy networking nerds from
the whole of Europe, including many from countries of the former
Soviet Union, were to be found pumping email messages from the room
full of terminals thoughtfully provided by a number of local computer
firms, through Polands new's 60 megabit gateway and thence to homes in
Georgia, Russia, Belarus, the Ukraine, Germany, Italy, France, the
Netherlands, the UK and even the US.
</p>
   <p>The need for "quality" networked information was one recurrent motif of
the conference; another (intimately linked with it by some) was the need
for commercialization of network facilities. To quote the first speaker
I heard: "we need to find a way for people to be paid for putting
information on the internet". By contrast, there was mercifully little
gung-ho technobabble, though the closing speaker did assure us that
"every human being on the planet" would have access to the network by
the end of this century, and that future conferences would require the
use of virtual reality helmets. In its place, there was a surprisingly
stubborn anglo-saxon stress on "bringing services to end-users".
</p>
   <p>The session on training began with a presentation on the UK's mailbase
service, funded by JISC and hosted at Newcastle: its un-surprising
conclusion was that electronic communities need a lot of hand-nurturing
and training, a theme picked up by another speaker from Newcastle, who
described an ITTI project which is producing generic training materials
for network awareness. How not to do it was well exemplified by the
third paper in this session - which described a protoype international
EARN helpdesk: having relied on member states to provide publicity for
its services, this was singularly underused.
</p>
   <p>Favourite software of the conference was undoubtedly Mosaic, which was
demonstrated live in a bravura display of networking nerve by Robert
Cailliau from CERN: pointing and clicking from Honolulu to Oslo to
Israel before our very eyes.  Mosaic is also probably the nearest thing
we currently have to the "User network interface to everything (UNITE)"
which was proposed by an equally charismatic speaker from Northern
Ireland, while mention of it also elicited my favourite mixed metaphor
of the conference from the speaker (George Brett) who said that although
it was essential to keep pushing the envelope and going in at the
deepend, it was necessary at the same time to keep the VT100 user on
board (who is this user? I think we should be told).
</p>
   <p>Yet another Newcastle speaker (Jill Foster) drew a rather neat analogy
between the current state of network publishing and the Sorcerer's
Apprentice episode in Walt Disney's Fantasia. In this analogy, the
techies currently trying to cope with the unmanageable explosion of
networked information are Mickey Mouse contending with all those mops
and buckets of water, while the librarians are the sorcerer deus ex
machina who will finally restore order, by applying their
classificatory, cataloguing, filtering, and archiving skills.
</p>
   <p>Other sessions I attended included a German speaker on something called
UDINE which sounded like another universal interface, but with the added
attraction that it would take advantage of ATM (nothing to do with holes
in the wall, this stands for 'asynchronous transfer mode' and is
apparently the very next thing in broadband ISDN). A Norwegian speaker
described an interesting experiment in creating a distributed archive of
photographs. An American speaker droned on about the problems of running
a Listserv discussion group. In the same session, I missed
(unfortunately) hearing the legendary Eric Thomas who was promoting a
new user guide explaining why Listserv is the true and only path to
righteous network communication. Rich Giordano flew in from Manchester
just in time to give a thoughtful paper about the need for interactivity
in information generating communities, and how poorly current models of
electronic libraries supported it, which had the unusual distinction of
citing some real evidence.
</p>
   <p>I spoke third in a session on "publishing on the network", shared with
Terry Morrow (who runs the BIDS service at Bath) and Ann Mumford (who
chairs the UK SGML Project and is a CGM whizz). The SGML banner, in
particular the TEI flavour, seemed to go down reasonably well --
everyone agreed that the best way of improving the "quality" of
networked information was to improve the richness of its markup.
</p>
   <p>On the whole, however, I did not find the papers presented here
particularly impressive. The real business of the conference was
evidently being conducted in a number of official and not so official
networking special interest groups and workgroups meeting there. Not
being a member of RARE or IETF or ISUS or others, there wasn't much
opportunity for me to participate in these politickings; I was also
disadvantaged by the fact that I had been placed in a monstrous hotel
some 20 minutes walk from the conference venue.  I did however spend
some time impressing on George Brett (from CNIDR) the importance of the
TEI Header as a starting point for one Internet Task Force which is
supposedly coming up with proposals to improve Gopher's usability by
providing associated documentatioon files. If the TEI Header can't be
used for that purpose, there's something seriously wrong with it -- and
likewise, if the IETF Task Force so charged completely ignores the TEI
proposals. This is something which perhaps others in the Steering
Committee with the ear of CNIDR might like to pursue (this means you
Susan H!).
</p>
   <p>Secondly I spent some time bending the ear of Robert Cailliau
(apparently a largeish cheese --or spider?-- in the World Wide Web) on
the subject of what's wrong with HTML. Unlike most HTMLers I've met,
this one at least was ready to listen, and something may just come of
it.
