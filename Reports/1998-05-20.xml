   <p>
      <ref target="http://nora.hd.uib.no/whatis.html">ICAME</ref>, the annual
get together for corpus linguists, was held this year in <ref target="http://www.hastingshotels.com/frames.asp?url=hotel_slieve.htm">
a luxurious Victorian hotel</ref> in Newcastle, Co. Down, where the
mountains of Mourne come down to the sea (and they do), organized with
great panache by John Kirk from Queens University Belfast. The food
was outstanding in both quantity and quality, there were magnificent
sea views, the weather was splendid, and the conference programme was
full of substance and variety.  With about a hundred participants, the
conference was not too big to allow for plenty of interaction and
socializing, even with a fairly crowded programme of sixty formal
papers and a dozen posters spread across three days. Also, I counted
nearly twenty presentations of one kind or another explicitly derived
from work using the BNC, <ref target="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2694/fast.html">which was (as they say) nice.</ref> In what
follows, I summarize briefly only those sessions I attended, passing
over in silence a few I could not attend either through an inability
to be in two places at once, or through conference-fatigue.
</p>
   <p>For the third time, it had been decided to hold a separate one-day
<mentioned>Historical corpora Workshop</mentioned> as a curtain raiser to the main
event. This was opened by <ref target="http://www.eng.helsinki.fi/doe/staff/rissanen.html"> Matti
Rissanen's</ref> annual survey of projects and resources for diachronic
corpus studies, now available or underway, in which he also said some nice
things about the <ref target="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk">Oxford Text Archive</ref>.
Irma Taavitsainen from Helsinki reported on a study of what
she termed "metatextual" comments in a <ref target="http://www.eng.helsinki.fi/doe/projects/eemw/">corpus of Early English
medical texts</ref> dated 1375 to 1550: the claim was that both form and
incidence of such comments as <mentioned>It is to be seen that</mentioned>, <mentioned>I will
now demonstrate</mentioned> etc change over this period to reflect other
changes from personal to impersonal modes of narrative, or from an
oral to a literary style. Terttu Nevalainen, also from Helsinki,
presented <ref target="http://www.eng.helsinki.fi/doe/projects/ceec/corpus.html">CEEC</ref>, an
interesting attempt to apply sociological criteria in the design of a
Collection of Early English (1417-1681) Correspondence. Of necessity,
the 6000 letters making it up had all been taken from published
editions, (thus introducing a rats-nest of copyright problems), and
also thus to some extent reflecting modern editorial practices in such
matters as spelling or selection procedure (less than a sixth of the
letters are from women, for example).  Nevertheless, the corpus is
clearly of immense interest as a way of quantifying and detailing
hypotheses about such phenomena as the social distribution of you/ye
forms, or the changes from <mentioned>-s</mentioned> to <mentioned>-th</mentioned> verbal forms, or
the use of <ref target="http://www.eng.helsinki.fi/doe/projects/ceec/recent.html"> multiple
negation.</ref>
   </p>
   <p>In the first of two papers about the <ref target="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~ehe/real/lampr.htm">Lampeter
corpus</ref>, I rattled through <ref target="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/wip/Lampeter/">an account of its
design and encoding</ref>, focussing mostly on the problems of getting
from a semi-SGML form of markup to one which actually validated
against a TEI dtd, before Claudia Claridge (Chemnitz) reported on some
real work done using it as a source of information to substantiate
theories about the development of scientific thought; for example, the
lexical patterns typifying the empirical approach, and the gradual
replacement of active voice reporting forms by passive constructions
over the century that this corpus samples.
</p>
   <p>After our first experience of a Slieve Donard lunch, Douglas Biber
(Arizona) author of <ref target="http://www.cup.cam.ac.uk/scripts/webbook.asp?isbn=0521496225">a
recently-published book on corpus linguistics</ref>, described an
application of factor analysis techniques to 18th century
English. Unlike <ref target="http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/~Adam.Kilgarriff/biber.asc">
previous work</ref> in which the parameters studied had been derived
from 20th century material, this work began by constructing a number
of specifically 18th century "dimensions" along which the rates of
occurrences for a wide range of linguistic features were shown to
cluster in different ways in texts taken from ARCHER corpus. Different
genres are then identifiable by their location along these dimensions.
</p>
   <p>Ann Curzan (Michigan) reported on a study of the shift from
grammatical to natural gender agreement for anaphoric pronouns across
the period 1150-1215 in the <ref target="http://nora.hd.uib.no/helinfo.html">Helsinki corpus</ref>: her study shows that this
was by no means a simple transition, involving both factors relating
to both lexis (some nouns remaining stubbornly gendered) and syntax
(eg distance between anaphor and antecedent). Christer Geisler
(Uppsala) presented a mass of data relating to postmodified clauses in
the tree-banked version of the Helsinki corpus, the purpose of which
went straight over my head. <ref target="http://eisv01.lancs.ac.uk/staff/gerry/gerry.htm">Gerry
Knowles</ref> (Lancaster) was also fairly recondite as to methodology,
but the purpose was plain enough: to identify the origins of northern
varieties of English by analysis of evidence from dialect maps rather
than on the assumption that they derived from some homogenous Middle
English dialect.
</p>
   <p>The Historical Workshop closed with a discussion as to whether or not
it was A Good Thing, or whether it would be better to roll its
contributions in with the rest of ICAME. Since ICAME's expansion is
now officially <mentioned>International Computer Archive of Mediaeval and Modern
English</mentioned>, I felt that it probably should; others, perhaps more
territorially minded, disagreed, and we all adjourned to the bar.
</p>
   <p>Next day ICAME proper began with John Kirk explaining the structure of
the event: there would be a a series of themed sessions, focussing on
major corpus development initiatives: today ICE, tomorrow the BNC,
then Birmingham, and so on.  He'd also planned a session on
dialectology, but the dialectologists had not co-operated. John
reminded us that the result of the Northern Ireland Referendum would
be due around tea time on Saturday, and that we all had a copy of the
consultation document in our packs, so that we could consider whether
or not the verbs <mentioned>exercise</mentioned> and <mentioned>discharge</mentioned> were in fact used
synonymously. A special excursion in the evening would take us to a
secret location near Belfast where the joint Anglo-Irish secretariat
would ply us with drink before the Referendum result hopefully removed
it (the secretariat, not the drink) from existence.
</p>
   <p>The ICE session began with a presentation by Baz Arts and Sean
Wallis from UCL of the <ref target="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/corpus-query/index.htm">
ICECUP</ref> annotation and search software.  This is a classy piece of
Windows software which allows you to search the completely parsed <ref target="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/ice-gb/index.htm">ICE-GB
corpus</ref> of one million words in terms of its linguistic
annotation. The interface looked a bit like the SARA query builder
screen, or the Linguistic Database (LDB) searching software developed
by Hans van Halteren for the <ref target="http://iris1.let.kun.nl/TSpublic/tosca/index.html">TOSCA</ref>
project many years ago -- but on steroids.  The idea is that the user
defines <mentioned>fuzzy tree fragments</mentioned> -- templates for nodes which are
to be matched in the complete syntactic tree. Each node has three
parts (function, POS category, feature) and the arcs can be
directional, or non-directional.  The system performed well and looked
good, but Sean spent rather a lot of his time explaining how model
based systems query front ends like this were an improvement on those
based on logical expressions, which whether true or not was fairly
uninteresting to non computer-scientists. There were promises of an
enhanced and extended ICE-GB corpus to be developed later, with the
software bundled, presumably contingent on grants coming through.  I
asked how the system handled contextual queries (since metadata wasn't
included within the nodes) but didn't understand the answer.  Chuck
Meyer, a real linguist, then reported his experience of using the new
system, and in particular of comparing its usability with his analyses
of the same corpus published in 1996: he focussed however on minutiae
of the results rather than usability issues which meant that I rapidly
fell asleep.
</p>
   <p>I awoke (briefly) to hear Atro Voutilainen and Pasi Tapainenen from
Finnish language engineering company <ref target="http://www.conexor.fi/company.html#1">Conexor</ref>, newly formed
to exploit the run away success of their English Constraints Grammar
Parser, probably the most widely used and amongst the most successful
of current automatic tagging systems for English. A new version called
<ref target="http://www.conexor.fi/np-parser.html#1">Englite</ref> is
now available on the web. Most of the technical detail of the Finnish
team's impressive work is available in publications elsewhere, to
which he gave <ref target="http://www.conexor.fi/analysers.html">several
useful pointers</ref> He also demonstrated some Unix tools for
processing the parser output, for example to produce new groupings of
idiomatic phrases. The tools look good, but you have to be a true
believer in dependency grammar to get the best out of them.
</p>
   <p>
      <ref target="http://crl.nmsu.edu/Lab/Personnel/jcowie.html">Jim
Cowie</ref> from New Mexico State repeated some fairly well-worn
observations about the role of corpora in improving automatic
translation, citing some nice examples (how to distinguish storms of
ice cream from snowstorms in a Spanish text) and also showing some
nice software. He said there was a need to enhance the lexica used by
your average MT system with frequency and contextual information,
which is as true now as it was when <ref target="http://www.purl.net/NET/lesk">Mike Lesk</ref> said it in 1986.
Ylva Berglund presented <ref target="http://clwww.essex.ac.uk/w3c/corpus_ling/about.html">
         <mentioned>World
Wide Web Access to Corpora</mentioned>
      </ref> from Essex, a JTAP project which
aims to demonstrate how corpora can be used in language teaching.  Her
presentation was meticulous but the project remains seriously
underwhelming from my point of view. Its future remains unclear and
there were some politely critical remarks from the floor about the
need for such a project to be a little less self-promoting, and maybe
more extensive in its coverage.  The afternoon was given over to
software demos, which went without a hitch: I demonstrated some of the
spiffier bits of <ref target="http://info.ox.ac.uk/bnc/sara.html">Sara</ref>, in particular how
to use it to examine differing usage patterns for the word
<mentioned>pretty</mentioned> as an adverb by men and women; the Zurich team
demonstrated their <ref target="http://escorp.unizh.ch/">impressive web front end</ref> to SARA, which they
promised we could distribute for them when it was ready; and I went
for a walk along the beach with Tony Mcenery. As to the secret
reception, we went by bus for miles along twisty Northern Irish roads
to a place surrounded with barbed wire which looked rather like a
converted school hall, where everyone had a lot to drink, and I
explained at least seven times to different people what the state of
the BNC currently was.
</p>
   <p>Next morning began with an hour of deeply statistical discussion by
Professor Nakumura and colleagues from Tokushima University, concerned
with various methods of automatically identifying text-type within the
LOB corpus. The rest of the morning was largely devoted to papers
reporting work done with the BNC.  It began however with two serious
papers from Douglas Biber and <ref target="http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/staff/geoff/geoff.htm">Geoffrey
Leech</ref> both derived from their Corpus Grammar work.  Biber's was
mostly on the ways lexical patterns explained explain different usage
rates in different registers for apparently interchangeable
constructions, in this case complement classes (verb+<mentioned>that</mentioned> vs
verb+<mentioned>to</mentioned>). Leech's focused on conversation, and proposed some
interpretations for the characteristic patterns of difference found
amongst the four basic genres analysed in their grammar. Speech is
characterized by shared knowledge, an avoidance of elaboration, a
plethora of interactions, a need to express emotion and stance,
freqent repetition of set phrases and (because of its time-based
nature) frequent front or back loading of syntactic structures. All of
these can be shown to underly the significantly different syntactic
patterns found in speech.
</p>
   <p>After coffee, <ref target="http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/staff/tony/tony.htm">Tony
McEnery</ref> lowered the tone of the proceedings by reporting with
relish his investigations into the naughty words used throughout the
BNC. He produced a number of examples to demolish various intuitive
claims about who swears about what to whom published by one G. Hughes,
and also remarked in passing how odd it was that the Norwegians came
in for so much invective in the spoken part of the BNC.
</p>
   <p>
      <ref target="http://www.es.unizh.ch/es/infoss98/info98byewelcome.htm#Lehmann">Hans
Martin Lehmann</ref> and <ref target="http://www.es.unizh.ch/es/infoss98/staffbio98.htm#Tottie">Gunnel
Tottie</ref> from Zurich reported a technique and some results for the
automatic retrieval of adverbial relatives (e.g. <mentioned>this is the place
where/at which/that/0 he found it</mentioned>) and for investigating their
different usage patterns. Automatically retrieving zero-marked
relatives is particularly tricky, even for the ingenious Lehmann,
involving running the untagged text through the Helsinki parser, to
identify potentially appropriate patterns, which are then manually
checked. Apparently, the manual search missed 20% of the cases found
by the automated process -- but the program was entirely at the mercy
of tagging errors in the parser.
</p>
   <p>Sebastian Hoffman, also from Zurich gave a thoughtful presentation
about the collocational evidence available from the BNC. Most people
believe that native speakers know many complex lexical items: but
empirical evidence showed that for relatively infrequent words there
were disparities between predicted collocates and those actually
attested in the corpus (using log-likelihood measurement of the
collocational strength). The question of how speakers recognize such
combinations in rare words remains open.
</p>
   <p>At this point, and in a major departure from ICAME norms, the
conference split into two parallel strands. I sat tight for two more
presentations on the BNC.  Roberta Facchinetti (Verona) presented a
study of preferences for <mentioned>will</mentioned> vs <mentioned>going to</mentioned> in speech and
writing, somewhat marred by the observation that the written part of
the BNC did not reliably distinguish reported speech. Jurgen Gerner
(Berlin) discussed the increasing use of <mentioned>they</mentioned> as what should
grammatically be a singular pronoun, used anaphorically to refer to
<mentioned>everyone</mentioned> or <mentioned>somebody</mentioned> (as in <mentioned>everybody should do what
he/they can</mentioned>): there seemed to be a preference for the singular
only with the <mentioned>some-</mentioned> form.
</p>
   <p>After the usual extravagant and irresistible lunch, we settled down
for an afternoon of presentations from Birmingham. <ref target="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~rkrish3/">Ramesh
Krishnamurthy</ref> briefly described TRACTOR, a research archive for the
various corpora and resources being created by and for the <ref target="http://www.ids-mannheim.de/telri/">TELRI</ref> project, which has
recently obtained a further three years funding for its pioneering
work in corpus-ifying the languages of Eastern and Central Europe. The
archive will include a number of interesting tools, integrated into a
single framework, as well as the various corpora already produced and
in production by TELRI member sites. Ramesh was at pains to
distinguish the project from <ref target="http://www.lpl.univ-aix.fr/projects/multext-east/index-en.html">Multext East</ref> (less specific) and <ref target="http://www.ilc.pi.cnr.it/euro.proj/parole.html">Parole</ref>
(more specific), but TELRI still sounds more of a club than a project
to me. Not that there's anything wrong with clubs (especially if they
will admit me as a member, which I did my best to persuade them they
should).
</p>
   <p>Geoff Barnbrook made deprecating remarks about the Bank of English
and <ref target="http://titania.cobuild.collins.co.uk/">COBUILD</ref>,
briefly touching on the political fallout from the recent massive
"downsizing" of the latter, before giving a fairly anodyne description
of a parsing system under development for the definition texts of the
COBUILD dictionaries. He was followed by <ref target="http://www-clg.bham.ac.uk/oliver/">Oliver Mason</ref>, who again
discussed the notion of <mentioned>lexical gravity</mentioned> in collocation together
with some useful techniques for its automatic calculation: this
remains no less impressive than when I saw it presented at <ref target="Http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/Reports/9704lodz.htm">PALC</ref> last
year, but does not seem to have advanced much since then.  Sue
Blackwell discussed how the words <mentioned>look</mentioned> and <mentioned>well</mentioned> are used
as markers of discourse function in a range of examples from the Bank
of English; Willem Meijs gave a fairly thorough overview of national
stereotypes as revealed by mutual information scores, but came to no
firm conclusions that I noticed, perhaps because my attention was
beginning to flag by this stage of the day. </p>
   <p>Revived by tea, I plumped for the parallel session for
annotation-dweebs (thus regrettably missing three papers on the
slightly unlikely topic of dialect studies in the BNC) and managed to
follow quite a lot of <ref target="http://agora.leeds.ac.uk/scs/public/staff/eric.html">Eric
Atwell</ref> and <ref target="http://agora.leeds.ac.uk/scs/public/staff/cs.html">Clive
Souter</ref>'s discussion of the problems of mapping between the outputs
of different parsing systems. As part of the <ref target="http://www.scs.leeds.ac.uk/ccalas/amalgam/amalghome.htm">Amalgam</ref>
project, they had attempted mappings between nine different parsers
and (despite the best efforts of <ref target="http://www.ilc.pi.cnr.it/EAGLES/home.html">Expert Advisory
Groups for Language Engineering Standards</ref>) concluded that for
syntactic analyses at least there simply is no obvious or even
non-obvious interlingua. Even something as simple as labelled
bracketting is controversial if you happen to be mapping an analysis
based on a dependency rather than a phrase structure grammar. This
dispiriting news was followed by an interesting paper from Yibin Ni
(Singapore) who had been trying to make explicit by tagging some
fairly recondite co-referential relations in discourse, but who did
not seem to have hit on any notational scheme adequate to the
purpose. Final paper in the session was from <ref target="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/geoffs/">Geoff Sampson,</ref>
presenting with characteristic clarity some of the problems in trying
to define an annotation scheme that can guarantee consistency if
application across corpora of transcribed speech: such common features
of speech as repair and truncation wreak havoc with the best designed
syntactic tagging schemes, to say nothing of the gaps in an analysis
caused by <gi>unclear</gi> elements. The day concluded with a
mammoth session in which each of the poster presenters got five
minutes to announce themselves, and a reception at which John Kirk
tried to explain some salient features of Northern Irish linguistic
history. I think.
</p>
   <p>My notes on the next day begin with <ref target="http://www.nus.edu.sg/NUSinfo/FASS/ELL/Vincent/">Vincent Ooi</ref>
(Singapore) who promised to explore the different "reality" evidenced
by collocational data from Singaporean and Malaysian English, but
instead gave only what I found a rather impressionistic account of
some multi-word phrases in English as she is spoke in the Straits. I
did however learn that Singaporean lifts are equipped with devices
which sound an alarm should anyone be taken short whilst inside: these
are rather unimaginatively known as <mentioned>urine detectors</mentioned>.
</p>
   <p>
      <ref target="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/users/eiamjw/martin.html">Martin
Wynne</ref> (Lancaster) presented the results of an interesting
comparison between two part-of-speech taggers: CLAWS, from Lancaster,
and <ref target="http://www-clg.bham.ac.uk/QTAG/description/tagger.html">QTAG</ref>,
from Birmingham. The comparison was effected by running both parsers
on the same corpus (the written half of the BNC sampler), mapping the
results into the EAGLES recommended annotation scheme, and comparing
the results. Martin conceded that this was grossly unfair on several
counts: the EAGLES scheme is much closer to CLAWS in the first place;
CLAWS was trained on the BNC; in cases of ambiguity, CLAWS uses
portmanteau tagging, whereas QTAG gives a prioritized list from which
they always took the first. He also spent a lot of time saying that he
didn't regard the results (in a corpus of over a million words, CLAWS
disagreed with the reference scheme 2% of the time, and QTAG about
15%) as proving anything, in which case one couldnt help wondering why
they were being presented.
</p>
   <p>Antoinette Renouf (Liverpool) reported on the next phase of her
unit's continuing and (I think) unique work on neologisms. The AVIATOR
project, which monitored the appearance of <ref target="http://www.rdues.liv.ac.uk/newwds.html#menustart">new words</ref>
in newspaper texts over a four year period, demonstrated that such
words tended to have very low frequencies, thus requiring the
development of rather rarefied statistical techniques for their
detection and classification. Such techniques having been developed in
collaboration with Harald Baayen from Nijmegen, Antoinette announced
the arrival of a new project called Analysis and Prediction of
Innovation in the Lexicon (APRIL), the aim of which is to develop a
system of automated classification, accounting qualitatively and
quantitatively for the features found in huge amounts of text, and
then extrapolate from this to predict the structure of the future
lexicon.  Allegedly.
</p>
   <p>
      <ref target="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/lals/staff/Graeme_Kennedy.html">Graeme
Kennedy</ref> (Victoria University of Wellington), author of <ref target="http://www.awl-he.com/titles/02648.html">the other
newly published book on corpus linguistics</ref>, presented an intriguing
paper on Maori borrowings into contemporary New Zealand English,
couched largely as a comparison between those reported in the new
dictionary of NZ english and those attested in a recently compiled <ref target="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/lals/wgtn_crps_spkn_NZE.htm">corpus of
spoken New Zealand English</ref>. Apparently, 77% of the words in the
dictionary are not attested in the corpus, while 86% of forms found in
the corpus don't appear in the dictionary.
</p>
   <p>Under the title <mentioned>It's enough funny, man</mentioned>, Anna-Brita
Stenström reported on some features of teenage talk familiar to
those with teenage daughters (e.g. use of <mentioned>enough</mentioned> and
<mentioned>well</mentioned> as adjective pre-modifiers) but maybe not to others. In
traditional ICAME fashion, she presented a mass of useful and
interesting evidence for these usages, and their typical contexts
based on searches of the <ref target="http://www.hd.uib.no/colt/">COLT</ref>
and the BNC; she had also used the <ref target="http://www.oed.com">online
OED</ref> as a source of comparative diachronic information, enabling
her to reveal that <mentioned>enough</mentioned> as a premodifier appears about 800
times in OED citations, while <mentioned>well</mentioned> is well frequent in Old
English, thus suggesting that teenagers have merely rediscovered an
enough established feature of Early Modern English.
</p>
   <p>Due to other committments, I had to make my excuses and leave at
this point, thus missing amongst other things a report on the <ref target="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/ucrel/projects.html#multimedia">Lancaster
multimedia corpus of children's writing</ref> as well as the closing
celebrations. Despite this sacrifice, I still somehow managed to
missed my flight home and had to spend an extra night at the Belfast
airport hotel. Even this did not dampen my enthusiasm for the event:
one of the best of a long series, and a hard act to follow.
