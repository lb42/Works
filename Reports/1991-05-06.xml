   <p>ICAME is the annual get together of corpus linguists. This year's,
(the twelfth) was hosted by Leeds University at a rather nice decayed
Victorian hotel on the edge of Ilkley Moor and enjoyed excellent
weather, the usual relaxed atmosphere and the usual extraordinary array
of research reports, which can only be very briefly noticed in this
report. As usual, there were about 50 invited delegates, most of whom
knew each other well, and a few rather bemused looking non-Europeans,
notably Mitch Marcus (Penn State) and Louise Guthrie (New Mexico SU).
The social programme included an outing to historic Haworth by steam
train which, alas, your correspondent had to forgo in order to attend to
other TEI business, and large amounts of good Yorkshire cooking, which
he did not.
</p>
   <p>
For the first time, the organising committee had included a so- called
open day, to which a number of interested parties, supposedly keen to
find out what this corpus-linguistics racket was all about, had been
invited. As curtain raiser to this event, I was invited to present a TEI
status report, which I did at break neck speed, and Jeremy Clear (OUP)
to describe the British National Corpus project, which he did at a more
relaxed pace. The open day itself included brief presentations from Stig
Johansson (Oslo), on the history of ICAME since its foundation in 1973,
from Antoinette Renouf (Birmingham) on the basic design problems of
corpus building, from Sid Greenbaum (London) on the design and
implementation of the new co-operative International Corpus of English
project, from Eric Atwell (Leeds) on the kinds of parsing systems which
corpus linguistics made possible, from Jan van Aarts (Nijmegen) on the
Nijmegen approach to computational linguistics, from John Sinclair
(Birmingham) on the revolutionary effect of corpus linguistics on
lexicography and on language teaching, from Gerry Knowles (Lancaster) on
the particular problems of representing spoken language in a corpus and
from Knut Hofland (Bergen) on the technical services provided for ICAME
at Bergen. While none of these speakers said anything particularly new,
several of them (notably van Aarts, Renouf and Sinclair) managed to
convey very well what is distinctive and important about the field. As
far as I could tell, most of the ICAME community was a bit dubious about
the usefulness of the Open Day. For outsiders wishing to get up to speed
on why corpus linguistics is interesting and why it matters however, I
would judge it a notable success. 
</p>
   <p>
Corpus linguistics is, of course, all about analysing large corpora of
real world texts. To do this properly, you probably need a good lexicon,
and you will certainly finish up with one, if you do the job properly.
Not surprisingly therefore, the conference proper began with a series of
papers about electronic lexica of various flavours, ranging from the
CELEX database (Richard Piepenbrock, Nijmegen) in which a vast array of
information about three languages (Dutch, English and German) is stored
in a relational database, to the experimental word-sense lattices traced
by Willem Meijs' Amsterdam research teams from the LDOCE definitions.
Work based on this, surely by now the most analysed of all mrds, was
also described by Jacques Noel (Liege) and by Louise Guthrie (NMSU). The
former had been comparing word-senses in Cobuild and LDOCE, while the
latter had been trying to distinguish word senses by collocative
evidence from the LDOCE definition texts: although well presented and
argued, her conclusions were rather unsurprising (highly domain specific
texts are easier to disambiguate than the other sort), and to base any
conclusions about language in general on the very artificial language of
the LDOCE definition texts seems rather dubious.
</p>
   <p>
The traditional ICAME researcher first quantifies some unsuspected
pattern of variation in linguistic usage and then speculates as to its
causes. Karin Aijmer (Lund), for example, reported on various kinds of
`opener's in the 100 or so telephone conversations in the London-Lund
Corpus, in an attempt to identify what she called routinisation
patterns. In a rather more sophisticated analysis, Bent Altenberg (Lund)
reported on a frequency analysis of recurrent word class combinations in
the same corpus, and Pieter de Haan (Nijmegen) on patterns of sentence
length occurrences within various kinds of written texts. 
</p>
   <p>
Although attendance at ICAME is by invitation only, an honourable
tradition is to extend that invitation to anyone who is doing something
at all related to corpus work, even a mere computer scientist like Jim
Cowie (Stirling) who began his very interesting paper on automatic
indexing with the heretical assertion that restructing the type of text
analysed was essential if you wanted to do anything at all in NLP. The
object of his research was to identify birds, plants etc. by means of
descriptive fragments of text and his method, which relied on
identifying roles for parts of the text as objects, parts, properties
and values, both highly suggestive for other lines of research and
eminently pragmatic. A similarly esoteric, but only potentially
fruitful, line of enquiry was suggested by Eric Atwell's report on some
attempts to apply neural networks to the task of linguistic parsing. 
</p>
   <p>
Another nice ICAME tradition is the encouragement of young turks and
research assistants, who, when not acutely terrified, are often very
good at presenting new approaches and techniques. This year's initiates
included Simon Botley (Lancaster), who presented a rather dodgy
formalism for the representation of anaphoric chains, Paul Gorman
(Aberystwyth) who had translated CLAWS2 into ADA and almost persuaded me
that this was a good idea, Christine Johansson (Uppsala) who had been
comparing `of which' with `whose' - almost certainly not a good idea and
Paul Rayson &amp; Andrew Wilson (also Lancaster) who had souped up General
Enquirer to do some rather more sophisticated content analysis of market
research survey results by using Claws2 to parse it.
</p>
   <p>
Two immaculately designed and presented papers concerned work at the
boundary between spoken speech as recorded by an acoustic trace and by
transcription: Anne Wichmann (IBM) presented an analysis of `falls' in
the London-Lund corpus, a notorious area of disagreement between
transcribers. Her elicitation experiment tended to show that there was a
perceived continuity between high and low falls which transcribers could
not therefore categorise. Gerry Knowles (Lancaster) proposed a model for
speech transcription, in which perceived phonemic categories formed an
intermediate mapping between text and acoustic data. Speech
transcriptions require a compromise between patterns that can be
computed from text and interpretations derived from acoustic data.

High spots of the conference for me were the presentations from
O'Donoghue (Leeds) and Marcus. If there is anyone around who still
doesn't believe in systemic functional grammar, Tim O'Donoghue's
presentation should have converted him or her. He reported the results
of comparing statistical properties of a set of parse- trees randomly
generated from the systemic grammar developed by Fawcett and Tucker for
the Polytechnic of Wales Corpus with the parse trees found in the same
(hand-)parsed corpus itself. The high degree of semantic knowledge in
the grammar was cited to explain some very close correlations while some
equally large disparities were attributed to the specialised nature of
the texts in the corpus.

Mitch Marcus (Penn State) gave a whirlwind tour of the new burgeoning of
corpus linguistics (they call it `stochastic methods') in the US, and
made no bones about its opportunistic  nature or  or funding priorities.
Incidentally providing the conference with one of its best jokes, when
remarking of the ACL/DCI, the Linguistics Data Consortium etc.  "People
want to do this work extremely badly, and they need syntactic corpora to
do it",  he described the methods and design goals of the Penn Treebank
project, stressing its engineering aspects and providing some very
impressive statistics about its performance. 
</p>
   <p>
Several presentations and one evening discussion session concerned the
new `International Corpus of English' or ICE project. Laurie Bauer
(Victoria University) described its New Zealand component in one
presentation, while Chuck Meyer (UMass) described some software
developed to tag it (using Interleaf) in another. The most interesting
of these however was from And Rosta (London) who is largely responsible
for ICE's original and, for my taste, rather baroque encoding scheme:
itvtook the form of a detailed point by point comparison between this
and the TEI scheme with a view to assessing the possibility of
converting between them. The verdict was largely positive, though he
identified several points where TEI was lacking, some of which (notably
the inability to tag uncertainty of tag assignment and a whole raft of
problems in tagging spoken material) should certainly be addressed and
all of which provided very useful and constructive criticisms. 
</p>
   <p>
There was a general feeling that standardisation of linguistic
annotation (which corpus linguists confusingly insist on calling
`tagging') was long overdue. Marcus pointed out that the LOB corpus had
used 87 different tags for part of speech, LOB had upped this to 135,
the new UCREL set had 166 and the London Lund Corpus 197. In Nijmegen,
the TOSCA group has an entirely different tagset of around 200 items
which has been adopted and, inevitably, increased by the ICE project. It
seems to me that someone should at least try to see whether these
various tagsets  can in fact be harmonised using the TEI
recommendations, or at least compared with the draft TEI starter set
described in TEI AI1 W2. I also think that someone should at least try
to see how successful the feature-structure mechanisms are at dealing
with systemic networks of the POW kind.
