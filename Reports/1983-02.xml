   <p>At
this second meeting of the working party, I presented a paper
describing the current state of Famulus and putting forward the
various proposals for improving it that I have accumulated over the
years. My paper which summarises the features of 6 different
implementations of the package in 4 pages was tolerably well received
and it was agreed that it should form the basis of a circular to all
Universities and Polytechnics' Computing Services to elicit
information about other versions of Famulus, other proposals, and to
estimate the requirement for packages of this type. This circulation
will be done before October (not by me); the Working Party hopes to
report back, probably recommending that someone should be funded to
tidy-up ythe source and add the most popular extensions to it, (not
me) by the end of the year. It was generally felt that there was about
6 man-months of effort needed to bring the package up to scratch and
to add the required enhancements. It was tentatively proposed that the
work might be carried out at Manchester or York, and that Edinburgh
PLU might become a central distribution site for the package, but
since neither York nor PLU were present at the meeting, these
proposals were deferred till after the feed back – if any – from the
circulation.</p>
