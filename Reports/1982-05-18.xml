More than 50 happy BASIS users attended this first official meeting
of the newly constituted UK User Group. After constitutional
discussion, elections of officers etc., there was an hour and a half
presentation concerning Release L of BASIS, due for beta test in
January of 1989. Somewhat to my surprise, this new release promises
to rectify lots of the more irritating fundamental shortcomings of
the package. For a start, somewhere in Dublin (Ohio) a nettle had
been grasped, and the internal format of BASIS files will never be
the same again: this means that true proximity matching will be
possible in release L (i.e. the index postings will give word
position as well as context position within document); it also means
that minor irritations such as the horrendous updating process are
completely removed, and that the system changes necessary to
facilitate real-time update in a future release are already in place.

Other encouraging trends are:- a committment to support more
"document architecture" type facilities (sections within full text
documents; extensions to the current 'hidden string' features to
support non textual objects; support for SGML markup on input;
increases on all current limits ) and a variety of improvements to
the user interfaces to the package. Three levels of interface are
identified: at the corporate level, specialist programming will
continue to use high-level languages, for which COBOL and FORTRAN
preprocessors will be provided in addition to the current "CALL"
facilities; at the departmental level, the current facilities will be
maintained, expanded somewhat so that for example the VT100 based
screen handling available with Long Text is available with all data
types; at the individual end-user level a new module called EXPRESS
will offer a PC-style interface with somewhat reduced capabilities,
using ring menus, full screen working (for VT100s) and integrated
query and update of documents. And the really good news is that all
of this comes free for existing customers as an incentive to migrate
databases from K to L.

After an excellent lunch, (during which I met fellow academic users
from Imperial and Aston) we were entertained by a man from Wapping
describing how News International had eventually decided to build up
their own in house story database, rather than relying on bureau
services (too expensive and too slow) or old fashioned cuttings
libraries (too heavily picketted). Two interesting things emerged
from this: firstly that it had at first been thought cheaper to have
the copy re-keyed in the West Indies than to use the stuff typed in
by the journos themselves; secondly that even on The Times it was
necessary to add keywords to identify story contents, since headlines
were increasingly too jokey and elliptical for the purpose.  Other
fields added to each story during the hectic 12 hours between its
appearance in print and its inclusion in the database include any
corrections advised by the legal department; these will both
presumably be of greater importance when the Sun is included in the
database later next year. I also learned that, new technology or not,
post-printout editing (a practice still carried out at Wapping) is
known as  "cutting on the stone". News International is also keenly
aware of the commercial potential of their database and is already
considering licensing such spin-offs as an online sports service,
law reports on CD-ROM etc.
</p>
   <p>The remainder of the day was given over to very dull self-
congratulatory salesmanspeak, listing all the new customers gained
over the year (of which News International was probably the most
significant, though Oxford University also featured, I regret to
say). When John Townsend began droning on about the importance of
addressing the marketplace in terms of the way he drove product, I
slunk away. But the news about release L was worth hearing: if only
half of it is true (and most of it is "committed") BASIS does have a
real competitive edge.
