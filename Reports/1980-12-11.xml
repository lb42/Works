Meeting and AGM</head>

   <p>This two
day meeting began with reports on recent activities in the field of
literary and linguistic computing from the various ALLC
Representatives around the world: about ten different countries (all
European except for the ubiquitous J.Joyce (USA-East)) were
represented in person, while nearly 40 written reports had been
submitted. The report of the ALLC Working Party on networking and
databases was also tabled; it includes a recommendation that a
database of information about machine-readable texts and software for
processing them should be established along the lines discussed at an
earlier meeting of the working party in London. Both at this meeting
and at the ALLC's subsequent AGM I briefly described the proposed
format of this database and requested information for it. Initial
validation of the designed system will be carried out in early 1981,
by using it to keep track of issues of OCP. It will then be expanded
to include issues of texts from the Oxford Archive. Data collection
from other sources will continue in parallel, in collaboration with
University College Swansea, using the UMRCC filestore as a staging
post.</p>
   <p>There were two formal sessions of invited papers, one on
machine translation and the other on computer-aided lexicography. The
MT session was opened by from the EEC with the disarming statement
that SYSTRAN (the product in which 5 million units of account -about
$20 m- will be invested over the next 5 years on your behalf and mine)
is obsolete from both the linguistic and the computational
standpoints. Nevertheless (as is often said) it WORKS for translation
of scientific and technical literature only for certain host/target
pairs of languages only and with no post-editing.An experimental batch
system for translation of scientific abstracts will be made available
via EURONET within the coming year. Meanwhile research towards a
European replacement for Systran (EUROTRA) would continue, though
funding was not yet committed. Subsequent speakers summarised the main
features of the Eurotra project. Keill (UMIST) demonstrated that
Systran (which is entirely written in uncommented IBM Assembler) could
not easily be enhanced except by adding greatly to the complexity of
the existing dictionaries. Eurotra by contrast would be a modular
system of great flexibility, deriving from 4 dynamic 'strategic'
component which interfaces its -fairly traditional- parsing algorithms
with its equally traditional static dictionaries. Eurotra however has
no 'real world knowledge' built into it and is light years away from
an 'Understanding' system. Maegaard &amp; (Copenhagen) described
Eurotra's interface structure which is essentially a simple dependency
tree the nodes of which are labelled for four levels of analysis
(morpho-syntactic, syntactic function, logico-semantic and
semantic-relational) Ambiguity is more easily resolved when these four
levels of linguistic description are available simultaneously, while
the loss of word-order inherent in a tree represent­ation actually (it
is claimed) aids translation. There is of course nothing particularly
novel in this formalism and its limitations (chiefly the absence of a
knowledge component) have been known for many years. M. King
(Cambridge) 's description of the so-called Semantic Component in
Eurotra was clearly aimed at a non-specialist audience and did little
more than exemplify some of these limitations. Nevertheless, for a
system designed to deal only with technical writing, Eurotra seems a
great advance on Systran if only because it has a clear underlying
linguistic model, the inadequacies of which are clearly defined and
understood. It is in no sense an experimental design, and appears to
have learned very little from even comparatively recent advances in
AI.</p>
   <p>For no very good reason, delegates were then treated to a
short presentation of ADA by one C.Gram (Copenhagen). The main
features of this latest attempt to emulate the perfection of Algol68
were however clearly of little interest to the majority of the
somewhat bemused audience and of no interest at all to anyone who has
read an article in Computing.</p>

   <p>The
next day's session was opened by W.Kartin (Liege) at his most
magisterial with a panoramic survey of the various activities that
might be described as computational lexicography. As is often the case
with such surveys I gleaned little from it save the classic assertion
that "AI people are concerned with how to understand language,
i.e. how not to misunderstand language". The level of computational
expertise involved is best illustrated by a lengthy discussion of how
the text of dictionary entries could be sorted on secondary fields in
order to produce lists of synonyms or 'pseudo-synonyms'. Zettersten
(Copenhagen) gave an informative account of the newly-revived
Dictionary of Early Modern English Pronuciation Project
(DEMEP). Dictionary slips indicating pronunciation are being gathered
in a fairly conventional form by teams of scholars based at Stockholm,
Bergen, Berlin and Aachen from hundreds of early printed sources to
produce what will (if it comes to fruition) be an invaluable reference
work on the development of English pronun­ciation over the period
1500-1800. The project is linguistically unfashionable and
computationally unexciting; nevertheless it has the far from
insignificant merits of a well-defined and worthwhile
goal.</p>
   <p>Winfried Lenders (Bonn) gave a workmanlike description of
the 6 or 7 computer held lexicographic databases available in Germany
(where such activites are now co-ordinated by a government agency, of
course). His account was informative rather than analytic. As might
have been expected there was little common ground amongst the
materials described since they had all been tailor-made for different
purposes. The problems of integrating such disparate sources (which
seemed tthe obvious next step) were only touched upon. Finally Marie
Bonner (Saarbrucken) described the six year old Old Icelandic
Dictionary project in which half a million words of legal texts are to
be the basis of the first ever lemmatised word index of Old
Icelandic. The project had evidently benefited from a clear linguistic
analysis of the process of lemmatisation (particularly difficult when
dealing with old manuscript material); but no evidence was given of
any comparably sophisticated computational analysis during the
development of the project.</p>
