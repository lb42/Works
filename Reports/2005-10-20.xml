   <head type="event">Rencontres TEI francophones</head> 
   <head type="location">ATILF, Nancy</head>
   <head type="date">20-21 octobre 2005</head>

   <p>This was an interesting two day meeting hosted by ATILF, and
organized by Susanne Alt and Veronika Lux-Podalla, which brought
together a number of key TEI users and interested parties in the
francophone world. It followed up a preliminary meeting also held in
Nancy at INIST during the spring, at the time that Nancy established
itself as a TEI host.</p>

   <p>The programme combined themed sessions of presentations, and
parallel discussion groups. Following some words of welcome from the
director of ATILF and from the European TEI editor, it began with a
session on dictionaries and terminology. Christiane Fritze (Academy of
Sciences of Berlin) reported on the results of a demonstration project
using TEI as the exchange format to permit interaction between a group
of previously encoded (in various formats) historical dictionaries,
and a corpus of digital texts, aided and abetted by the usual panoply
of XSLT stylesheets and an eXist database. I was taken by the way in
which the research group works: each month they choose a new project
in the general area of promoting scholarly awareness in the
humanities, and work on it. Despite its small scale, this was a
persuasive demonstration of the benefits of using TEI markup to
integrate the outputs of previously independent projects.</p>

   <p>This was followed by a presentation on similar themes from the
"kompetenzcentrum" (I think we would say "centre of excellence") at
the University of Treves, given in Germlish by Hannes Greil and Niels
Blohnert. Their kompetenz seems to be mostly is in retro-digitization
of major historical dictionaries and their subsequent integration with
corpora of historical materials in German. Most of the dictionaries
they discussed were originally encoded in Tustep, and even their
conversion to XML was carried out using Tustep. The scale of their
operation was impressive however.</p>

   <p>Laurent Romary reminded us of the difference between a dictionary
which maps words to senses, and the  semasiological  orientation of a
terminological database, which maps concepts in a defined domain to
words. He sketched out his ideas for a reformulation of the.late
lamented TEI terminology chapter, and made a persuasive case for the
general usefulness of such a chapter in the P5 -- if only someone
would draft it.</p>

   <p>A lady whose name I forgot to write down reported on the
deliberations of a joint ATILF/INIST workgroup concerning the
applicability of the TEI Header, and its place in the metadata
universe. The group aims to define a minimal header for use in the
cataloguing of material "born digital", in particular electronic
theses: where have I heard that before. They like the fact that the
header permits such richness of metadata (arborescence is the french
word), but think it needs to be constrained. She also presented some
comparisons (and mappings) with OLAC and Dublin core, but did not,
curiously, mention METS. Apparently the structure of the TEI Header is
not derived from AACR2 but from ISO 2709.</p>

   <p>A consultant from a company called Archimed called Christophe
Arnoult described an interface developed to search TEI conformant
digital theses, using metadata apparently derived from other online
resources. The work had been done using a very small sample, and the
only interesting thing I noticed about it was their
application of statistical procedures derived from  the tag usage to determine
which header elements should be indexed and how. Otherwise he made the
familiar point that in the absence of clear guidance on how to apply
it, the TEI Header DTD provides more than enough rope for most
conventional retrieval systems to throttle themselves on, and
incidentally bemoaned the fact that people didn't always package
together all the resources needed to handle a document (e.g. where is
the DTD? where are the system entities referenced?)</p>

   <p>Denise Malrieu (Paris X) asked a good question and proposed an
impressive range of possible answers. The question was: what kind of
metadata might be useful for literary scholars working with narrative
texts; and the answers ranged far beyond purely
literary-historical-bibliographic perspectives to include internal
structural features and audience expectation, as well as summary
statistics and their deviance or otherwise from a norm. She also
talked about the viability (or otherwise) of automatic tagging of
various discourse features -- not only what the computational
linguists call "named entity recognition" but also narrative level and
status (dialogue, quotation etc). She also mentioned but did not
describe ongoing work in establishing appropriate parameters for
narrative text classification.</p>

   <p>After lunch (up the hill: chicken and chips), we divided into three
groups for more focussed discussions on (a) dictionaries, animated by
Susanne Alt; (b) metadata, animated by Laurent; and (c) electronic
theses, animated by Sylvie Gressillaud. I attended the last of these,
and watched as Gautier Poupeau walked through the most relevant
features of TEI Lite (using Oxygen), only occasionally muttering about
how different things would be in P5. These parallel groups then
reported back: the dictionary group had looked at Susanne's (excellent)
presentation; the metadata group had been introduced to Roma and
derived a simpler DTD for the header.</p>

   <p>Last session of the day discussed questions of documentation and
translation. Pierre-Yves Duchemin (Enssib, Lyon) briefly sunmmarised
the actitivies of the G5 group which had started with the ambition of
translating the whole of the TEI Guidelines into French. They have
now produced a version of the P5 Header chapter and are working on two
others. However, they seem to have taken note of the comment I made
when visiting Lyon earlier this year about the need to base their
translation on the ODD sources rather than on their output. The
working relationship betrween this group and the TEI's own I18n
effort, on which Veronika reported next, remains somewhat murky to me. In
presenting what is planned for thew latter, Veronika provoked a
surprisingly heated debate about the wisdom (or otherwise -- most
people thought otherwise) of translating the element names in TEI
documents. </p>

   <p>The second day began with a very impressive presentation from
Gautier Poupeau (Ecole des Chartes) about the principles and practice
underlying their digital publication program. This was high quality
dynamically on the web,  conforming to the needs amnd expectations of
scholarly editors. </p>

   <p>Also impressive in its way was the presentation from Jouve, a long
established French electronic publishing house which is apparently now
piloting use of TEI as an interchange and delivery format for its
digitization activities. Denis Delvalle explained a workflow they have
now introduced in which OCR output, expressed in a detailed
proprietary format, is transformed into TEI, and then converted to the
customer's specific requirements. Interestingly, Omnimark is still
their weapon of choice in this struggle.</p>

   <p>And finally, I gave that talk about Xaira again, this time
translated into halting French, and augmented with live
demonstrations of assorted French corpora running on a borrowed
laptop. </p>

   <p>After lunch (up the hill again, steak and chips this time), Laurent
and Veronika chaired a discussion about next steps and further
missionary activity. It was agreed to hold a focussed training session
on developing the digital thesis plus header customisation front just
before Christmas and to try to provide nmore input and discussion
material on the website. The idea of a TEI summer school was
floated. And there was some discussion about what exactly Veronika
should report to the members meeting next week.
</p>

   <p>Overall, this was a reassuring, even encouraging, workshop. There
were over 20 participants, mostly but by no means exclusively local,
and from different backgrounds. The problems raised and issues
discussed are would resonate with any TEI user anywhere in the world;
unlike some other such gatherings, however there was an evident
committment to making the TEI work, by participating in its
development and promotion. </p>
