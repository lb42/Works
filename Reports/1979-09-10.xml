   <p>About 300 people from over 70 different
British Universities and Polytechnics attended this year's IUCC
Symposium at the University of Warwick. OUCS was represented by FAS
(this years chairman), LH, SL and LB (who contributed a paper on
IDMS). As at most such gatherings, there was ample opportunity to
exchange important gossip, horror stories and absurd boasts with
colleagues from other computing centres, quite apart from the
scheduled sessions. There were five of these, on micro-computers,
distributed and large scale computing, databases and graphics. Each
session consisted of a keynote address by an invited speaker, and four
or five shorter presentations of varying quality. Of the invited
speakers, Dr Jim Alty (Liverpool) was probably the most impressive. He
described in some detail the range and quality of support offered to
micro users at Liverpool. Liverpool run quick practical courses for
Intel 8080, 8085, Motorola, TI 9900 and the ubiquitous PET machines,
programming in BASIC and PASCAL. Applications include data capture
(often in inhospitable regions such as the Sahara), control systems,
communications and data processing. Dr Alty mentioned in passing that
only one tenth of the Â£2 m allocated to the DES for micro-supported
research was used last year.  Other papers in this session included
one by D.Holdsworth (Leeds) describing a new Pascal interpreter, which
occupies 1K on the 6800, and one by S.Jameson (Aston) on the
programming of an.intelligent terminal to interface with a standard
commercial (i.e. unintelligent) information retrieval system.  The
session on distributed computing was opened by C. Whitby-Strevens
(INMOS) who, quoting extensively from Jensen, urged us to forget
everything we already knew about computing, stressed that conventional
algorithmic languages (except maybe ADA) and souped-up sequential
algorithms were more hindrance than help, and generally annoyed
everyone. Of the other speakers in this session only J.C.Boarder
(Oxford Poly) appeared to agree; he described a language, LZ, with
some novel parallel features based on work by Dijkstra. I The session
on large scale computing was opened by Dr G.R.Field (UMRCC) who, after
a brief political history of university computing, asked several
questions (are 60 micros in a ring worth 2/3 of a CRAY-1? how many
Atlases do you need to lay end to end in order to make a Cyber 203? is
it a meaningful exercise anyway? and above all Is it worth the money?)
but provided no answers. In the same session, P.Gray (European Centre
for Medium Range Weather Forecasts) gave an interesting account of
experience with the CRAY-1. Mean time between faults is it was
revealed over 60 hours, which happens to be crucial for the
Weathermen, one of whose applications runs for over 6 hours. To some
extent confirming Whitby-Strevens, he stressed that to get the best
out of the machine, some re-design of the algorithms employed was
necessary - doing more arithmetic could actually reduce processor
time. The database session was opened by Dr M.Atkinson (Aberdeen)
substituting at very short notice for a speaker from Grenoble, with
the heretical propositions that 'databases are for programmers' and
that a fully generalised Database Management System was
impossible. His main interest was in Computer Aided Design systems,
for which existing dbms are undeniably <pb facs="Pages/img389.jpg"/>cumbersome. He described a system
currently being designed which included a component called the Data
Curator to control data security and integrity and handle transmission
of it to and from various CAD micros on a ring. Other speakers at this
session included H.Robinson (Hatfield Poly) on data modelling
techniques; M.Newton and A.Gawronski (Open) on a new relational system
to be used in the new (&amp; highly recommended) OU database course;
and L.Burnard (Oxford) who, asserting that IDMS is after all only a
package, attempted to describe how to set up a database in 10 minutes
and was suitably penalised by being cut off in mid-example. The
session on graphics was opened by K.Brodlie (Leicester) with a
comprehensive survey of the various systems available. He pointed out
that standard general purpose software tended inevitably to lag behind
the capabilities of new hardware and also gave a flavour of the new
NAG graphics chapter promised for Mark 8. This final session also
included another screening for a rather fine piece of computer
animation made using GHOST in 1965, and accounts of two;interesting
applications. One (Owen &amp; Earnshaw, Leeds) uses an interactive
graphic display as a means of rapidly inputting musical scores in any
of the various internal foirmats commonly used. These can then be
displayed or printed on conventional staves. The other (Best, Aston)
uses a composite eliptical graph to display the interaction of eight
pathological parameters as an aid in diagnosis. The system is used
experimentally at the patients bedside. Full details and abstracts of
the papers given at the event are available on request ,
