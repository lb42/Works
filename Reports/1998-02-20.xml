   <p>
      <ref target="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/chemnitz/chemnitz.html">Chemnitz</ref>
is a large town in Saxony (you may have heard of it under the name of
Karl-Marx-Stadt, when it was a large town in the DDR) notable for a
well-established University, which has just had the good sense to
elect as its pro-vice-rector (sounds less implausible in
German)Prof. Dr. Josef Schmied, director of the <ref target="http://www1.tu-chemnitz.de/~ehe/real/real.htm">REAL English
language centre.</ref> Josef is also a corpus nut, and the originator of
the <ref target="http://www1.tu-chemnitz.de/~ehe/real/lamphome.htm">Lampeter
corpus project</ref>, which is why I was pleased to receive an
invitation to visit his centre for a two day workshop on language
teaching with computers.  funded by the <ref target="http://www.britcoun.de">British Council in Germany</ref>.
</p>
   <p>I was one of four invited Brits, each of whom was allocated 90
minutes talk on the first day; the audience consisted of about 40 
assorted teachers from other German Universities and Language Centres
some of whom were allowed to speak (but only for 20 minutes each) on
the second day, before a round up discussion session.
</p>
   <p>Before all this began, however, there was a little ceremony in
which a Very Important Person from the British Council in Berlin and
the Vice Rector himself signed a renewed cultural exchange agreement
which would ensure that Chemnitz students might continue to enjoy
partnership arrangements with a variety of UK universities in the
interests of greater mutual understanding, the spread of the true
British language, and so on. We also had a little talk from Frank
Frankel, now retired from the Council but retained as a consultant in
co-ordination of language centres throughout Germany, and a long-time
enthusiast for CALL, as to how its wider use might change the roles of
teacher and learner.
</p>
   <p>Josef Schmied gave a brief overview of curent projects at TUC
involving language-learning with computers (LLC), of which probably
the most interesting is the Internet Grammar project: a web-based
system for language learners, teachers, and linguists to collaborate
in developing a kind of translator tool for the teaching of English
grammar.  Unlike the UCL project of the same name, which is
monolingual, the Chemnitz project is aimed very specifically at
translators' syntactic needs; it also aims to synthesize inductive and
deductive procedures to establish rules.
</p>
   <p>Hilary Nesi, from Warwick, gave a well focussed and informative
review of the pedagogic usefulness (or otherwise) of a range of
English language dictionaries available on CD-ROM; she also waxed
lyrical on the potential classroom usefulness of the humble hand-held
dictionary-type device, if only their manufacturers could be induced
to give them more linguistically-oriented features instead of
overloading them with electronic organizer type facilities.
</p>
   <p>Geoffrey Leech, from Lancaster, gave a very interesting talk about
the grammar of spoken English, derived from a major new work on which
he is collaborating with Stig Johansson, Doug Biber, Ed Finegan and
others. The corpus underlying this is a 20 million word corpus
comprising the spoken part of the BNC and a parallel corpus of
American spoken material, collected according to the same principles
by Longman, but not (so far as I know) available to anyone outside the
project. Beside presenting and analysing an impressive mass of
comparative data, with far more detailed examples than I can present
here, he made some very cogent suggestions about their potential
relevance to language teaching. The availability of well based
frequency information for various syntactic constructions could be
used not just to determine actual usage, and thus to provide authentic
examples of usage, but also perhaps to help determine which
grammatical structures should be taught, and which were most
appropriate for different varieties of English, or types of discourse
-- both areas in which language learners have most difficulty -- thus
(to use Geoff's phrase) "maximizing communicative payoff" both in
production and reception.
</p>
   <p>I gave <ref target="http://info.ox.ac.uk/bnc/using/papers/burnard96a.htm">the
standard talk</ref> about the BNC again, including a live demonstration
of the BNC Sampler, and a little coda stolen from <ref target="http://www.sslmit.unibo.it/bertabs.hatm/guypage.htm">Guy Aston</ref> about how
the BNC can be used by learners to challenge their teachers, which
seemed to go down well.
</p>
   <p>Gary Motteram from Manchester's <ref target="http://www.man.ac.uk/CELSE/">Centre for English Language Studies
in Education</ref> discussed some of the pedagogic issues in using IT
for language teaching, based on his extensive experience in running a
Masters degree in TESOL, which is now done entirely online, and
sounded to my relatively untutored ear like a model case study in
IT-based distance learning. He demonstrated, and advocated, the use of
Toolbook as a low price, easy access, tool kit for the construction of
powerful courseware.
</p>
   <p>At the end of this long day, the British Council took us all to an
a rather unusual performance at the Schauspielhaus. <title>Das
Ballhaus</title> is a kind of musical-cum-ballet, presenting fifty years
of German history through the device of a dance hall, in which a
massive and highly skilled cast waltzed, tangoed, drank, and generally
overacted through the terrible twenties, the even worse thirties, the
unspeakable forties, and the unbelievably depressing fifties, before
succumbing to the degenerate sixties, the cacophonous seventies, and
the incomprehensible eighties. The piece lasted three and a half
hours, with an interval, and the theatre was unbearably hot, but it
was oddly compelling, being full of humour and incident, and quite the
most extraordinary display of really bad tailoring I have ever
seen. Although entirely non-verbal, and although almost all of the
music was entirely familiar and accessible, it also demonstrated how
far shared knowledge and experience is essential to understanding a
culture -- the second half in particular being full of incidents which
the East German contingent found riotously funny or touching but which
left the rest of us entirely bewildered.
</p>
   <p>The next day was given over to a mixed bag of presentations from
other happy recipients of the British Council's bounty (in the shape
of exhange agreements with UK universities). Regrettably I missed the
first of these -- a group from Rostock describing a proposed
diachronic newspaper corpus comsisting of samples of high, middle, and
low brow British newspapers from three centuries.  Speakers from
Magdeburg's Otto von Guericke University and from various units of
Potsdam University described their experiences in setting up IT-based
learning resource centres, aka Self Access Centres or SACs, and in
using the internet as a source for such things. There were also brief
consumer reports on a various workshops attended (thanks to British
Council funding) at a number of UK institutions. Sound principles
(teachers should act as guides not experts; teach how rather than what
etc.) were articulated and many favourite web sites cited.
</p>
   <p>Dr Thomas Bellman, from Leipzig's Hochschule fur Technik Wirtschaft un
Kultur, demonstrated some nice software for cataloguing ELT resources:
it looked like your standard bibliographic database, but included hot
links which would start up bits of courseware directly from the
record, screens which enabled you to pre-define subsets of records
according to ELT-relevant categories, and buttons for access to a web
browser, a wordprocessor, ond even a virus checker, all embedded
within the same interface. I did not have the heart to murmur "OLE?"
</p>
   <p>Dr Jurgen Martini (also from the Otto von Guericke University in
Magdeburg, but a different part of it) gave a defiantly non-IT-based
presentation about the difficultiues of teaching cultural studies
which kept promising to open up a new area of discussion, but didn't
quite do so. The courses he teaches sound very interesting though.
</p>
   <p>The Workshop's final speaker, Bernd Rueschoff (from Karlsruhe), has
the unusual ability to make CALL-theory sound interesting, as well as
knowing how to make a very impressive presentation. He covered a very
wide range of pedagogic issues, ranging from the need for authenticity
in language learning and cultural studies, the use of technology as a
means of enriching rather than replacing the traditional learning
environment, and the drive towards active participation in learning
rather than passive acquisition of information. He also had some
practical advice to offer on how exactly to achieve these motherhoods,
based on substantial experience.
</p>
   <p>I concluded from all this that, like the rest of us, German
institutions have both Language Centres and Linguistics Departments,
and are not quite sure whether IT has a role to play in either,
neither, or both. They are also rather vague about whether corpus
linguistics belongs in linguistics or cultural studies, or both, or
somewhere else. All of these constituencies were represented, eying
each other somewhat nervously, at the workshop; and if there wasn't a
lot of rapprochement, there was a respectable amount of talk.
Recurrent topics in the discussion included the impact of
"self-access" as a way of learning rather than simply as a means of
doing pre-set assignments, and doubts as to its general applicability
for all students; anciety was also expressed about the possible
dangers of allowing students access to politically incorrect notions
over the internet, and the need for reliable assessment of networked
resources, at which I felt a plug for <ref target="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~humbul">Humbul</ref> would not be out of
place.
</p>
   <p>I stayed on for an extra day after the workshop ended in order to
show the Chemnitz team what I had been doing with their Lampeter
corpus, and to discuss plans for future collaboration. This took so
long that I never got round to doing any respectable amount of sight
seeing, which is why this report is regrettably deficient in my
reactions to the new Germany, the architectural oddities of Chemnitz
(yes, Karl Marx's head is still there, just across the road from
McDonalds) and Dresden (wonderful palace -- shame about the traffic
system), or the delights of Saxon cookery. But it's probably long
enough as it is.
