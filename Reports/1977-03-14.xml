Applications committee DMUS Seminar</head>
   <head type="when">14 March

   <p>Alan Purvis (CGF, Bracknell) gave a brief presentation of
some of the features of DMUS and drew attention to some of its
deficiencies. He had used all of the utilities, but discussion centred
on the use of DATAVALIDATE, EXTRACT, REPORT and SORT. I have a copy of
a summary report he made, Deficiencies noted include: ambiguous syntax
in FML (eg. use of continuation symbol obligatory before THEN and
forbidden after it; unsatisfactory IF...THEN..ELSE..nesting), absence
of job type (character/numeric) conversion on output, and more
seriously, absence of any facilities for group items (COBOL
'arrays'). The latter deficiency will however be removed in the next
release, B64. A serious inefficiency is that each line of a BASIC
PROCESSING module has to be interpreted afresh for each record
processed. BASIC PROCESSING modules are not however necessary for most
DMUS Applications. Mr Purvis confirmed, unofficially, a rumour that
ICL had no plans to provide the 'translated ML' facilities advertised
in the manuals within the foreseeable future. Amidst universal
lamentation the meeting broke for lunch. After lunch, possible
applications of DMUS in the University environment were
discussed. Both Southampton and SWURCC were thinking of using such
facilities as SORT and REPORT to analyse user-metering
records. Edinburgh pointed out that SORT, RECORDLIST etc. were of
obvious utility to the generality. Kent were concerned that many DMUS
facilities were not available with VME/K. It was also pointed out that
SORT in particular should be more efficient than any user-written code
as it calls MAMPHY etc. directly. There are no SCL equivalents for
such commonly used facilities as COPY, BLOCKCOPY, RECORDLIST or
BLOCKLIST. It is probably too early to say exactly which applications
will use DMUS most, but the meeting clearly felt theat it would have
to be used in the University environment, despite its
deficiencies. Another meeting would be held in 6 months to exchange
experience gained using the package. </p>
