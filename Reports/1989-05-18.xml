   <head type="location">Samson-Sitjthoff BV, Alphen an der Rijn</head>
   <head type="date">18 May 1989</head>


   <p rend="bo">Location and attendance</p>
   <p>The meeting was hosted at Alphen an der Rijn
(Netherlands) by <hi rend="bo">Samson-Sitjthoff BV</hi>, part of a
major Dutch printing and publishing  conglomerate,
 whose Information Services division is directed by
<hi rend="it">Jan Maasdam</hi>, chairman of the Dutch SGML users'
group. The SIG itself was set up very recently by its
current chairman, <hi rend="it">Martin Bryan</hi>  (author of the
only  readable book on  SGML) who  works for a
division of the SEMA group called <hi rend="bo">Yard Software
Systems </hi> but is also closely associated with
SOBEMAP and MARKIT, their   SGML parser. The
SIG has about half a dozen active members drawn
largely from major European software houses with
an interest in the field. Its chief remit seems to be
discussion of the interface between SGML  and
database design,  but  this was only the third
meeting and the group has not yet felt the need to
create a formal constitution or  agenda. </p>

   <p rend="bo">Agenda for meeting</p>
   <p>The agenda was as follows:
<list>
         <item>Application of linguistic methods and tools to database
management of SGML coded texts.  <hi rend="bo"> Gert van der Steen</hi>  from
MID, a Dutch software house</item>
         <item>The TEI: an application of SGML in scholarly research.<hi rend="bo"> Me</hi>
         </item>
         <item> Performance comparisons of some UNIX-based RDBMS
<hi rend="bo">Fran√ßois Chahuneau</hi>  of AIS, a French software house</item>
         <item>General discussion of a paper  on conceptual modelling for a
document database tabled at the previous meeting by <hi rend="bo">Han
Schouten</hi>  of the TFDL (the Dutch Agricultural Ministry)</item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p rend="bo">Presentatations</p>
   <p>Van der Steen's presentation was overlong and
rather rambling for  the occasion, but  raised some
interesting points about the benign influence of
computational linguistics  in  the development of
SGML (a DTD -he said confidently- is a formal
grammar) and the appropriateness of hierarchic
database systems to it. His company is developing
an "Integrated Publishing Management System"
entirely dependent on SGML as transfer
mechanism, which had necessitated a detailed
specification for an ideal text retrieval system. He
also  described his own PARSPAT system  which
uses recognition of syntactic patterns as a database
search mechanism (he has recently published a
book on the unification of pattern-matching,
recognition, parsing and transduction) and gave
examples of its use for analysing the Brown Corpus
and a database of 18th century Delft Estate
inventories</p>
   <p>My presentation simply outlined the structure of
the TEI, gave some examples of the horrors of 
unchecked scholarly markup and discussed the
relationship between text and databases.  </p>
   <p>Chahuneau 's company has the task of constructing
a document database  to support  EEC legislative
and other documents in  nine languages in parallel. 
Its scale (15,000 pp in the printed annual form) 
and complexity set it apart from any  other SGML
applications I have yet come across.  Because the
database is  constantly changing, sophisticated
version control and integrity checks are essential to
maintain all nine views of it in parallel. This ruled
out any of the traditional text retrieval database
systems; hence the case study of available UNIX
RDBMS. Decisive factors in narrowing these down
proved to be their degree of support for the 8-bit
characters of ISO8859 (essential for the 9
languages);  and the way in which the software
implemented crucial database operations. Only
three of the nine systems investigated allowed the
manipulation of 8-bit characters as well as their
storage. As to software performance, it seems that
the ideal system would combine INGRES' query
optimiser (which made an order of magnitude
difference to the speed of join operations) with the
SYBASE  file-access engine (which had a similar
effect on most other operations). An investigation
of the various hardware platforms available showed
perhaps unsurprisingly that although a 
RISC-architecture machine such as the new DEC
Station gave enormous performance improvements,
the low-end 386-based machine was a better
price/performance option for development than
any of the other available workstations. </p>
   <p> Discussion of Schouten's paper was less focussed than it
merited, largely due to the lateness of the hour.  
Schouten had advocated using a conceptual modelling technique
known as NIAM, rather than the more usual Entity-Relationship
model (which would have pleased Chahuneau and me) or a straight
hierarchic datamodel derived from the DTD (which would have pleased
van der Steen). He had not paid much attention to such specific 
problems as version control, which seemed to imply the need for
a formalism superior to the DTD, the semantic adequacy of which was
already in question. </p>
   <p rend="bo">Contacts made</p>
   <p>Both Chahuneau and Bryan expressed interest in the work of the TEI,
and a willingness to participate if invited. I took the opportunity of
rehearsing some of the current Committee 4 arguments with them (both agreed
that attributes were not formally necessary, but still extremely usefull).
If we do decide to involve either of them, Bryan might be a better
SOBEMAP representative than Gaspart, while Chahuneau or
his nominee would be a good substitute for Dendien on committee 4. Either
of these would be self-financing. It is important to stimulate
SOBEMAP interest since they have EEC funding for their MARKIT product
which is the only structured editor I have so far come across that
runs in the MS-DOS environment we all know and loathe.</p>
   <p>I met <hi rend="it">Jens Erlandsen</hi>, whose company TEXTware A/S 
based in Copenhagen is developing Gestorlex, which seems 
to be yet another SGML-based structured 
editor for dictionaries and other reference books. They also market
a small free text browser of the Gofer-type, and are involved 
in an ESPRIT project to develop a multi-media publisher's workbench. 
The novelty in the latter is that they plan to implement Salton's 
"space-vector model" for the full text indexing requirement.</p>
   <p>
      <hi rend="bo">Kluwers</hi>, publishers of <hi rend="it">CHum</hi>, turn out to be a part
of the same publishing empire as our hosts. They were represented by
Drs van Wijnen, who seemed quite taken with the notion that <hi rend="it">CHum</hi> 
contributors might be amenable to supplying their material complete
with SGML tags. She agreed that this was worth suggesting to the
<hi rend="it">CHum</hi> editorial board at any rate.</p>
