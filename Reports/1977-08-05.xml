   <p>Up to 200 people
attended the Summer School, mostly from Italy, France, USA, Canada and
W.Germany; smaller national groupings included the English, Belgian,
Dmtch, Czech, Yugoslavian and E.German (all about half a dozen
each). There were also at least one Pole, one Vietnamese and an Indian
from Moscow. Over two-thirds of those present were linguists and
probably half of these had no computational experience. Almost all
were engaged in academic research, mostly of post-doctoral or doctoral
level. The summer school consisted of a dozen forma1 courses of
lectures of varying lengths, workshops and informal
discussions.</p>
   <p>The courses reflected the interests of the majority
in that the strictly computational element was slim. The star in this
respect was M.K.Halliday (long regarded as the Grand Old Man of modern
linguistics) whose course demonstrated the enormous complexity of
understanding and producing natural language, and the complete lack of
homogeneity in the typos of knowledge to do so. By contrast, Yorick
Wilks (equally undoubtedly the Machine Intelligence Superstar of the
Seventies) gave an optimistic and remarkably thorough overview of the
various systems for understanding natural language developed over the
last ten years. Wilks (a philosopher by training) has a witty
lecturing style and maintains a lordly indifference to the petty
squabbles of nomenclature which bedevil the field. He brought out the
intrinsic similarities of much recent work, and stressed that the
relation between these and recent developments in theoretical
linguistics was closer than suspected. Wilks' course was complemented
by a two-week course taught (in a ruthlessly pedagogic manner) by Luc
Steels (U of Antwerp, now at MIT).Though called 'an introduction to
computational linguistics', -this course in fact simply presented in
some detail the formalisms used to express meaning in the field and
gave more technical details of many of the systems described by
Wilks. Typical material covered included LISP type lists,
phrase-structure grammars, case-structure grammars, semantic
structures (eg. Schank's "conceptual dependency" graphs, Winograd's
PLANNER) and, most important, transition networks. Steels gave
sufficient detail of how different parsing systems operated to suggest
that implementation was comparatively trivial, and also discussed in
more general terms other cognitive formalisms such as frames, scripts
and the Knowledge Representation Language of Bobrow &amp; Winograd. A
specific example of a transition network was discussed in another
course, given by Ron Kaplan (Xerox, Palo Alto) who, with R. Woods,
designed the first successful ATN-based parser and has now expanded it
considerably. (An ATN is a method of representing a given syntax or
grammar in a Transition Network; the A stands for Augmented, and
indicates that some or all of the transitions may include predicate
tests, case functions, structure building acts etc., thus including a
semantic component in the system)</p>
   <p>In addition to these full
length courses, I attended parts of a course given by George Lakoff
(UCLA,Berkeley) on linguistic "gestalts" -a new concept in theoretical
linguistics suspiciously similar to the AI "frame" concept , an
informal discussion at which I spoke on the Oxford Archive, and an
introductory LISP course. I also found a couple of potential Oxeye
users and a lot of texts for the Archive. There was an attempt to
organise a football match "Linguists v. Computers", but it failed
through lack of computational support.</p>
   <p>Approx 5 kg. of printed
paper came put of the Summer School, and is on its way hither if
anyone wishes to know more about it. I also have course notes for
Steels' course and a useful bibliography.</p>
