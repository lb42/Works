   <p> This disastrous day began with the realisation (around midnight)
that the  batteries in my alarm clock needed replacement. Foolishly
disregarding this  evil omen, I prevailed on British Telecom to wake me
in time for the 0715 train  to Manchester, which they duly did. British
Rail however was less satisfactory.  Said train, having staggered
through the Midlands in a desultory manner,  finally collapsed inside
the tunnel leading into Birmingham New Street, where  it was officially
declared in a memorable piece of BR-ese "a failure awaiting  replacement
engine", just as the connecting service to Manchester departed. The next
connecting service to Manchester was also twenty minutes late, for good 
measure, so that I missed another connection at Crewe. So it was that my
 Shakespeare demonstration was presented to royalty while I wandered 
disconsolately around Crewe station in search of something remotely
interesting  to read. I finally arrived at W.Gorton at 1245, just in
time to hear D. Daice's  last sentence on receiving the coveted gong (in
fact a large slab of perspex)  from the hands of a well-tailored George
V look-alike.
</p>
   <p> There were about fifty ICL CAFS luminaries present, and about half
a dozen  users all from the CAFS CUA WP, while HRH Price Michael of Kent
(the aforesaid  lookalike) fielded a modest team of four minders in very
natty suits (though  not as natty as his own). Over lunch (a visually
dramatic if bland cold  collation of salmon disguised as submarine,
turkey disguised as frog, veal  disguised as chicken and roast beef in a
party hat) I learned that the  Shakespeare demo, handled by Les Teare,
had gone down well with HRH, who had  also been presented with his very
own OPD. This was incidentally the  first time anyone had told me that
my humble PQR program was to be given the  regal once-over (and on an
Estriel too). I had also missed one of H.  Carmichael's rapid summaries
of the wonders of CAFS which was variously  described to me as too
technical (by A. Hutt who also confirmed that PDS was  now a dead duck
and asked why we didnt write our own PDS to QM bridgeware in  Prolog)
and really comprehensive (by the appalling D. Lovegrove who wanted  a
certain compromising passage in the CAFS WP Report altered). I met
various  dignatories from the history of CAFS, only previously known to
me as names in bibliographies, such as G. Scarrott, J. M. Evans, L.
Crockford and also V.  Maller. From T. Wansborough I learned that the
Fortran Interface was also a  dead duck; in fact probably the only good
news for OUCS to come out of the  whole ridiculous affair was the
promise of a pre-release of DCI-200 this year,  endorsed by both
K.Watts' boss and G.Haworth. After lunch and the royal  departure, we
were all presented with a nice commemorative medal now on display  in my
office (please form an orderly queue) and the option of a guided tour 
round the premises. I foolishly took this up, and was consequently
rather bored by vast acreage of unnaturally tidy machine room, stainless
steel boxes, 600  megabit cables, girls rewiring boards etc. Just before
rushing to catch a train  which didn't actually exist, I met L. Teare
who had a few interesting things to  say about running my software on
series 30: guess what, it sometimes gets the  counts wrong, just like
our very own CAFS engine.
</p>
   <p> Back in the hands of BR, I was only mildly surprised when the train
I did  finally catch (the 1725 from Manchester) suffered an engine
failure somewhere  near Dudley, fairly resigned to the hour's delay at
New St while a new engine  was found, and almost amused when, some ten
minutes later, on the way into  Birmingham International, the wheels of
the coach I was travelling in began to  give off smoke due to faulty
braking systems. An unfortunate BR executive on  his hols was also on
the train and did much energetic rushing up and down and apologising to
passengers. <hi>Mirabile dictu</hi>, the train to which we were all 
transferred then ran without incident, arriving in Oxford a mere 15
minutes  after its scheduled time, i.e. 2245. Cycling home I calculated
that of  seventeen hours awake so far, eleven had been spent on a train 
in various  stages of collapse. There must be easier ways of getting a
free lunch.
