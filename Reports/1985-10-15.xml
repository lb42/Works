   <p>INDEPOL (Intelligence
Defence and Police) is the first ICL packaqe developed exclusively as
a front end for CAFS; its name reflects the marketplace at which it is
targetted, and also its origins. It was developed by ICL Defence
Systems with funding from MoD, originally as a way of making CAFS-800
(the hardware precursor of CAFS-lSP) usable outside Stevenage. It has
had a lenqthy gestation, reflected notably in its complete
independence of ICL's current strategic product line. Thus, it
accesses CAFS facilities via the RSI to RECMAN directly; it has its
own internal Data Dictionary; it enforces its own privacy mechanisms
independently of VME. The only point of contact in fact is TPMS, which
it relies on to handle concurrency, (see further below).</p>
   <p>INDEPOL
differs in several ways from the conventional static DP package, quite
apart from the wonders of CAFS. Its data model is completely flexible;
restructuring being unnecessary because of its reliance on SIF. The
model contains only things called domains and relationships, the
latter not explained in any detail; domains are more-or-less SIF data
items, in the physical data model, as well as files and records (the
latter containing mostly SIF items only though fixed length fields are
supported) it has things confusingly called record sets which are
actually dynamically created collections of record keys held in
virtual store. They are also working on something like value-based
sets between files. It has extensive access control mechanisms,
implemented by additional predicates added invisibly to every
query.</p>
   <p>What sets it furthest apart from the query products we
know and love however is its update facilities. Records are updated in
situ, (hence the reliance on ISAM), any contention being handled by
VME. A modified record is immediately available for searching. (I
don't think this is is true even of DCI based systems, which cannot
open files in read/write mode). </p>
   <p>Its user interface is
startlingly simple: you can use either (dynamically created; forms or
a very simple command language which has minimal clutter. Fuzzy
matching and quorum conditions are described by a syntax arguably
closer to natural language than DCI's The same forms can be used for
input and output. Macros can be defined both to abbreviate commands
and conditions and also for record sets.</p>
   <p>The launch was a very
professional affair. We were treated to a dramatic slide show loosely
derived from Raymond Chandler, in which various fragmentary clues were
presented to a private eye. The online demonstration then used INDEPOL
to solve the case by searching various files for leads indicated by
said fragmentary clues, This was both entertaining and
impressive. After lunch (passable pie, decent wine, unambitious
salads, disgusting coffee), there were more demonstrations. The whole
affair was very carefully stage managed; each group of punters
(entirely from the military and the police, so far as I could tell)
having its appointed ICL minder to fetch its drinks, introduce it to
the right boffins and keep it apart from the other punters. P. Leggate
from the English faculty library and I had our new salesman all to
ourself, who revealed that he was hopeful of getting funds from DTI to
get the package released to one University site, presumably either us
or QMC. I may have blown it, by getting too embroiled in technical
discussion with Jim May (main guru behind the software) to pay much
attention to this heavy hint. I hope not: it looks like a very
interesting opportunity. And, to round off a perfect day, neither of
the trains I took broke down.</p>
