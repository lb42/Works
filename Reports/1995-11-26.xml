   <p> 
A TEI Workshop was organized by <ref target="http://grid.let.rug.nl/~galiard"> 
Harry Gaylord</ref> at the University of
Groningen in the Netherlands 21-22 November 1995. The workshop was
hosted by Harry's department at the University, with additional funding
from <ref target="http://www.nic.surfnet.nl/surfnet/surfnet.eng/home.html"> 
SURFNET (the Dutch equivalent of JANET)</ref> and attracted an
impressively large number of delegates, not all of them Dutch (there
was a small group of Francophones, Swiss, Belgian and French; also some
Spanish and Portuguese; but no visible Germans, no doubt owing to the
similar event in Tuebingen the week before). I counted about 120 during
the opening plenary, and even by the final session there were well over
fifty. Although dogged by administrative and technical mishaps, ranging
from the collapse of one of the presenters with influenza 24 hours
beforehand to the dispatch of the printed course materials to some
other conference in an adjacent province, I'm glad to report that the
event appeared to have been very well received by all who attended, with
much discussion and questioning, both enthusiastic and intelligent,
during the sessions and afterwards.</p> 
   <p> 
Day 1 began with a series of plenary lectures: I gave the celebrated
<ref target="http://www.uic.edu/orgs/tei/sgml/teip3sg/index.html"> 
"Gentle introduction to SGML"</ref>, followed by two other invited speakers:
Bert Bos from the <ref target="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Consortium"> 
W3 Consortium</ref> spoke illuminatingly about the
<ref target="http://grid.let.rug.nl/~sgml95/bertsum.html"> 
relationship between SGML and HTML</ref>, and the great hope afforded by the
proposed stylesheet mechanism in HTML3; Gert van der Steen  gave <ref target="http://grid.let.rug.nl/~sgml95/steensum.html"> 
an
exhaustive overview of SGML software</ref>, characterized by its functions.
After a break we were joined (virtually) by Rich Giordano, who gave a
very impressive lecture on the <ref target="http://grid.let.rug.nl/~sgml95/giordano.html"> 
TEI Header</ref> and his thoughts about its
relationship to projects in resource discovery, by video tape recorded
in his office in Berkeley. We knew it was live because at one point the
phone rang (it was Harry reminding him to make the video) and at
another someone tried to walk into the office.</p> 
   <p> 
The TEI Workshop proper began with a presentation of the TEI
architecture (regrettably using my fallback set of overheads, rather
than the nice new version I'd prepared for use with Panorama), followed
by a group document analysis, using as vehicle some pages of the
Sherlock Holmes story "The Red Headed League". In the absence of
printed handouts, at that time finding their way back to us from the
aforesaid adjacent province, Alan Morrison and I had to perform this
text as well as elicit discussion of its chief features -- which turned
out to be quite an amusing experience for all concerned. Whether for
this reason or not, this session was very lively raising a number of
fundamental encoding issues in a satisfactory manner. The day concluded
with a presentation of the standard TEI document analysis slides, which
I gave from paper notes in the absence of anything flashier.</p> 
   <p> 
Day 2 was to have begun with the first of three graded exercises on
using <ref target="http://www.sq.com/products/refuthored"> 
Author/Editor</ref> and <ref target="http://www.sq.com/products/panorama"> 
Panorama</ref>, but it became apparent fairly
rapidly that the teaching room allocated for this purpose was simply
not set up correctly.  Delegates seemed philosophical about this,
occupying the time in such characteristically Dutch habits as checking
email and strolling down the corridor for a smoke, while we re-arranged
the timetable to allow a further hour's installation time. I gave
(again from backup slides) the overview of <ref target="http://www.uic.edu/orgs/tei/intros/teiu5.html"> 
TEI Lite</ref> and discussed
briefly ways of using it to implement the features we'd identified the
previous day. After lunch we divided the group up, with those
uninterested in Author Editor being free to go and inspect the various
demonstrations of student projects and other software (notably <ref target="http://www.microstar.com/products/main.html"> 
Near and Far</ref> and <ref target="http://www.sq.com/products/explorer.html"> 
Explorer</ref>).
</p> 
   <p> 
The rest repaired to the PC room and drove out a few hopeful students
who thought it was theirs. Alan and I then walked through our Author
Editor exercises successfully. In the first, we imported a "plain
ASCII" version of the Holmes text, tagging it as a single div, then as
a paragraph, then split the paragraphs. This taught use of the
surround, remove, split, and joint options. Then we exported the text,
looked at it in Write, and reimported it. In the second exercise, we
started from a blank new document, and built the skeleton of a full TEI
conformant text, using the "Insert markup" option to teach something of
the TEI header at the same time. In the third exercise, we imported a
version of the tale which Alan and I had tagged in some detail earlier,
with all direct speech identified and allocated to speakers. We then
showed how this markup could be displayed in Panorama, using previously
prepared stylesheets and navigators. This programme of work was fairly
exhausting for the 30 or so participants who stayed the course, and
entirely so for the two of us trying to give it, but it seemed to go
down well. I did finally manage to see some of the work which students
at Groningen have been doing -- an illustrated version of the Christmas
Carol; a morphologically analysed version of Hiawatha -- but not as
much as I'd have liked.</p> 
   <p> 
I was greatly impressed by the energy and enthusiasm of the Workshop
participants. They were very tolerant of the technical mishaps which
prevented the event from being as great a success as it deserved to be.
The local team, particularly the students, also deserve commendation
for their great resourcefulness in the face of adversity. I hope that
Surfnet will be willing to sponsor another such event in the near
future.</p>
