   <p>British Telecom gave an account of the query
processing system they have set up to interrogate IDMS databases. It
is an interpretive processor using nonstandard terminology and
obtaining its data through the back door (i.e. a copy of the schema
source) rather than from the IDMS directory; functionally it has
little if anything superior to Data Display 250 and in some respects
(output formatting etc) is markedly inferior. On the other hand it
cost BT 1 man/year as opposed to whatever outlandish sum DD
costs.</p>
   <p>Tom Wansborough (iCL) gave a good straightforward account
of the IDMS patch-up utilities Restructure and Reorganise, both of
which we have used here, the former as less successfully than the
latter. He also gave some useful tips on how to simplify restructure
when it was needed and explained patiently several times why PRIOR
pointers should always be used in volatile sets. Some figures on the
performance of Restructure were given - for "small" databases (a mere
200 Meg or so), a restructure time of 20-30 hours seemed to be
acceptable. I was too dumbÂ­founded to hear of installations where an
uninterrupted run of 20-30 hours was feasible, let alone acceptable,
to comment.</p>
   <p>After lunch, Richard Barker (iCL) gave a
presentation on the facilities which might be expected in IDMS
300. Consdierable improvements in performance had been implemented for
the commonest of DML verbs and also great improvements in security. It
would be possible to run IDMS and its associated components at ACR 10
and access to a database except via IDMS would be impossible. Various
minor user-requested enhancements (one of them mine!) would be
included. The most significant change however is the introduction of
separate storage schemas; the ability to default everything but the
logical description of data items in the schema in particular will
reduce the design-to-use time by an order of magnitude in our
environment.</p>
   <p>I raised 3 major problems we are currently having
or anticipate: one proves insoluble, one unpopular and one will go in
as an enhancement request.</p>
