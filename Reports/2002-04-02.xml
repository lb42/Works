   <head type="event">ALLC Roadmap Meeting</head>
   <head type="location">Pisa</head>
   <head type="date"> April 2002</head>

   <p>This year's mid-term committee meeting of the <ref target="http://www.allc.org">Association for
  Literary and Linguistic Computing</ref> was branded as a
  <soCalled>roadmap</soCalled> meeting (apparently a current vogue
  word for meetings devoted to navel gazing) which might hopefully
  produce some content for a <title>New Directions in Humanities
  Computing</title> panel session to be held at the close of this
  year's ALLC-ACH conference. In addition to ALLC committee members,
  the meeting, organized and chaired by David Robey and Harold Short,
  was attended by a small number of hand-picked invited experts from
  the field; I was given the task of presenting a summary of the
  issues raised during the course of the two day discussion, so had to
  pay attention. <ref target="0204pisaplans.htm">The meeting</ref> was held in Pisa, so the dinners were
  good. </p>

   <p>Each of the five sessions was supposed to address the same
  questions (<q>Where are we now?</q>, <q>Where are we headed?</q>, <q>What
  should our agenda be?</q>) from the perspective of the following five different
  application areas: 
  <soCalled>linguistics</soCalled> (Laslo Hunyadi and Elisabeth Burr);
  <soCalled>literary studies</soCalled> (Paul Fortier and Lisa-Lena
  Opas-Hanninen); <soCalled>Bibliography and  textual
   criticism</soCalled> (John Dawson and Wilhelm Ott);
  <soCalled>Libraries and archives</soCalled>(Espen Ore, Marilyn
  Deegan, Susan Hockey);  <soCalled>Multimedia and performance
   studies</soCalled> (Lorna Hughes and Jean Anderson);
  <soCalled>Methodologies and digital scholarship</soCalled> (Willard
  McCarty and Harold Short).
 </p>

   <p>I took a lot of notes, from which I distilled a final summary that
  seemed to go down quite well. You can read these notes at 
<ref target="0204pisanotes.txt">0204pisanotes.txt</ref>; here's
  a briefer and possibly less tactful summary of the chief conclusions I drew from
  the experience:
<list>
         <item>the major application areas for computers in the humanities
    disciplines continue to be in linguistics, textual criticism, and
    (arguably) library science;
</item>

         <item>in all of these areas, the research agenda is dictated by the
    discipline specialists; similarly, in other areas such as digital
    cultural heritage, all the significant developments are being
    undertaken by technical or cultural specialists, not by by
    cross-disciplinary theoreticians; </item>

         <item>a wider understanding of the theory and practice of textuality, markup, and
    text-encoding remains arguably the only substantive result of the
    last two decades of <soCalled>humanities
    computing</soCalled>
         </item>

         <item>the major contribution currently made by <soCalled>humanities
    computing</soCalled> specialists is in brokering collaborative
    work involving specialists from technical and non-technical
    disciplines;</item>

         <item>no-one had much of any substance to say about information
    extraction, data mining, distance learning, distributed computing,
    or other creative applications of the technology .</item>

      </list>
   </p>
   <p>However, as I said, the dinners were very good.</p>
