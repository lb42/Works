   <p>I travelled to Paris at the invitation of Francois Chahuneau, md of AIS,
to see the prototype of the system his company has developed on behalf
of the Bibliotheque de France, in connexion with their ambitious PLAO
(Poste de Lecteur Assiste par Ordinateur) scheme, on which I reported
last year. The prototype is for a scholarly workstation, which brings
together a lot of  interesting ideas about how scholars interact with
electronic text, both in transcribed form and as digital images.
Essentially it provides an integrated environment for the management of
texts, including their annotation, closely modelled on traditional
scholarly practice. The software runs on SPARC stations under X-windows
and uses PAT as its main retrieval engine, which means that its
performance is very impressive. Texts, both transcribed and in image
form, can be organised into (possibly overlapping) typed logical
'zones', annotated and given hypertextual links. Text and text image
can be synchronised, though only at a relatively coarse level. The
texts themselves are read-only, while annotations and structuring
information are dynamic, as is rendering. It uses SGML (of course)
though with a very simple dtd based essentially on the use of typed
milestones to mark zone boundaries, but can  take advantage of whatever
markup is present in a text. I had supplied Chahuneau with a TEI-style
marked up text which he was able to import directly into the system,
with impressive results. The query language used is particularly
powerful, and takes full advantage of the structuring capabilities of
SGML. The prototype will also be demonstrated at the
Waterloo conference next month, where I expect it to arouse
considerable interest: it combines much of the functionality of Dynatext
with the power of PAT and the user-friendliness of Lector. Licensing and
distribution arrangements are not yet clear, but it looks as if it will
be considerably cheaper and more 'open' than any of those products.
AIS are also planning to release a general-purpose tool kit for
converting SGML texts into other formats, known as Balise 2, which will
sit on top of the public domain SGML parser sgmls: this looks
particularly interesting.

   <p>While in Paris I spent an afternoon with Dominique Vignaud who has been
commissioned by Quemada and Tournier to assess TEI proposals for the
encoding of corpora as the main French contribution to the NERC
project. Vignaud is one of France's leading SGML experts (she was
responsible for an attempt to create a French version of the AAP
standard and also for my favourite expansion of 'SGML' -- Surement
Genial Mais Laborieux) and so I was much heartened by her enthusiastic
praise for the general design principles of the TEI. We discussed in
some detail the difficulty of reconciling the incompatible goals of
different research projects within an effective interchange framework.
The 'base plus topping' method advocated by the TEI seemed the best
theoretical solution, although for practical reasons it seemed likely
that a 'lowest common denominator' approach would be followed, with
Vignaud proposing as candidate for standardisation a simple subset of
TEI recommendations, not dissimilar to that used by the BNC, on which I
was also able to bring her up to date.
