<div xml:id="Report-2008-09-22" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> <head>Some notes on the "Network of Expert Centres" meeting, 22 Sept 2008 </head>   <p>In these post-AHDS, apres-Methods-Network days, a small amount of funding has been found to
        explore the possibility of setting up a "network of expert centres", aiming to develop an
        effective support infrastructure in the digital arts and humanities area. As a former AHDS
        centre, Oxford was invited to join the network, and I went along to this inaugural workshop
        of the network in place of Martin who is busy frying other CLARIN fish. The workshop was the
        first of four, to be held around the UK before the funding runs out at the end of this
        calendar year. It was organised by Kings and held at the Wellcome's subterranean conference
        centre on Euston Road.</p>
      <p>Lorna Hughes welcomed us by saying that the goal of this workshop was to investigate models
        of collaboration, and made the first of several references to <ref
          target="http://www.arts-humanities.net/">http://www.arts-humanities.net</ref> as being the
        vehicle to carry forward the network's outreach agenda. Present were several of the usual
        suspects, i.e. David Robey, Seth Denbo, Simon Tanner, Paul Spence, Harold Short, Sheila
        Anderson, Charlotte Rouche, John Bradley, Torsten Reimer, Heather Haskins, Lydia Horstman,
        and Elena Pierazzo (all from Kings), Barry Ife (formerly at Kings, now at Guildhall),
        Richard Deswarte (just taken over from Matthew Woolard at HDS), David Sheppard and Mike Pidd
        (from HRI, Sheffield), Stuart Jeffrey from ADS, Bronwen Hyde (Research Information Network),
        Joy Davidson (HATII), Aly Comteh (BL), Amy Robertson (VADS), Paul Ell (QUB), Andrew Prescott
        (Lampeter), and Alastair Dunning (JISC Digitization). Slightly bemused outsiders were Simon
        Coles from the EPSRC-funded National crystallography service at Southampton, and Ant Miller
        from the BBC.</p>
      <p>Introducing the first session, Sheila opined that the network represented "a very strong
        response" to withdrawal of AHDS funding, though there were still a number of key projects
        enjoying continued funding (she mentioned AHESSC, ADS, and A-H.net, as well as two european
        projects, DARIAH and CLARIN). We should be aiming to demonstrate the ability of the
        network's members to collaborate in provision of services which were really needed by the
        subject communities. The first session was intended to provide us with three possible
        collaborative models, presented by Barry Ife, Andrew Prescott, and Simon Coles. Barry's
        model was LCACE: the London Centre for Arts and Cultural Enterprise, which is a "club" or
        pressure group for nine London-based HEIs active in the cultural sector, some large, some
        small. It's supported by subscriptions (a flat rate of 35k a year) which the members
        apparently consider value for money as it enables them to devolve many matters of joint
        interest, such as potential commercial or academic collaborations, summer schools,
        consultancy, input to public policy on access to the arts etc. An interesting example: a
        school of nursing valued input from a school of acting about improvisation techniques.
        Andrew's model was based on his experience in Wales, where the political agenda of the One
        Wales manifesto has had an extraordinarily galvanising effect on the development of digital
        resources, aimed at enlarging access to digital cultural resources by the public, mainly
        within the library sector, and spearheaded by the national library. Support for individual
        researchers is less conspicuously present; he cited the wonderful <ref
          target="http://www.dafyddapgwilym.net/">www.dafyddapgwilym.net</ref> project as an example
        of something where sustainability (it uses Anastasia) had not been thought through; and also
        the Lampeter project on "Imaging the bible in wales", where a full projec-to-service model
        has not yet developed. Simon Coles took us for a refreshingly different canter through the
        ways in which chemists, at least, now benefit from social networking technologies, beating
        the drum very effectively for Open Notebook Science with several provocative soundbites
        (e.g. "If I don't put my exam timetable on facebook, no-one will turn up"). He did however
        say several very interesting and well-informed things about the role of digital repositories
        in supporting this new kind of science and the transformative effects of web2 technologies
        on the publishing process, as well as pointing to a number of URLs worth looking at. And
        that the way in which science is now done is deeply inimical to the top down way in which
        academic institutions are funded and organized. And that research projects should be
        top-sliced to pay for the costs of curating their data in institutional repositories. So I
        warmed to him considerably.</p>
      <p>After coffee, there was a brief discussion, focussing largely on the organisational
        mechanisms underlying the three collaborative models, which were largely unsurprising. David
        Robey remarked that collaboration has to be incentivised in some way; Sheila Anderson that
        mass digitization programmes did not necessarily meet the needs of individual researchers,
        who tended to take such things for granted. There was some dilatory discussion of possible
        business models, but this seemed to be fairly well-trodden ground. Alastair rather cheekily
        asked exactly what services the Network would provide, but did not receive a very detailed
        answer. Harold said that we were talking about infrastructure and that the AHDS
        infrastructure had depended to a great extent on the support of host institutions, many of
        which now felt a bit let down by the demise of the AHDS, which though undeniable did not
        seem to get us much further. The lady from RIN piped up that they had produced a report on
        data sharing we should all read and we broke for a modest sandwich lunch, during which Elena
        and I talked about genetic editing in the TEI.</p>
      <p>After lunch we were supposed to be focussing on "pragmatics". David Robey kicked off by
        summarising some results from a questionnaire on sustainability of resources he'd
        commissioned, which mostly seemed to confirm a general skepticism about the likelihood that
        institutional repositories will take on the burdens previously shouldered by the AHDS and
        the Methods Network. He did however point to the UK Data Service project at LSE as being
        maybe an indicator of future relevance. Harold followed this up with a rapid canter through
        an astounding variety of digital projects at Kings, drawing out particularly the
        collaborative nature of most of them. Charlotte Rouche gave an entertaining talk about the
        near-impossibility of getting elderly classicists like herself to understand the technology
        and why it was useful, (saying en passant nice things about the LGPN project); evidence of
        value was what was needed; maybe the learned societies should be our target rather than the
        funding councils. She is now something called the "e-strategos" of the Hellenic Society,
        which is nice. Finally, another fast-talker, called Ant Miller tried to explain how the BBC
        organizes its digital archiving, in the face of insurmountable technical odds. (e.g. the
        functioning lifetime of all currently surviving videotape players is inadequate to play back
        their current backlog of undigitized videotape. By a factor of ten, or so.) and an amazingly
        heterogenous internal structure, dividing itself both by media type (news, tv, radio) and by
        region. I learned that they have a wonderful conceptual model for all their data, which
        rejoices in the name of SMEF/LDM. And that, following development of something called a
        Target Operating Model, which focusses on business processes rather than the existing
        organizational structure, the BBC has apparently decided on a strategy which puts archiving
        of content ahead of actually broadcasting it.</p>
      <p>This was followed by a brief discussion about sustainability, and business models, with
        several brief recommendations about "cards" that might be played (e.g. the e-learning
        agenda, the implications of resource availability and use for research quality assessments)
        in making the case for the importance of the network. I can't say I noticed much of any
        substance being articulated; maybe my attention was wandering. In any case, the non-network
        participants at this point made their excuses and left, and the (second, I learn) meeting of
        the potential network partners proper began.</p>
      <p>The meeting closed at 5.30 and I got soaked on the way home.</p>

            >What should the Network of Centres be?</ref></head>

          <ref target="http://digitisation.jiscinvolve.org/">Alastair Dunning</ref>
        </head>
        <p>I envisage the Network as providing an accredited range of centres that comprise the
          different types of expertise necessary for creating and delivering digital resources in
          the arts and humanities.</p>
        <p>Thus when other institutions want to create a resource but do not have these types of
          more technical expertise required to develop a digital resource they know they can work in
          partnership with one or more of the centres (rather than reinventing the wheel and doing
          everything themselves)</p>
        <p>The kind of levels of capabilities that these centres should have include</p>
        <list>
          <item> *Data capture </item>
          <item>*Metadata and mark-up </item>
          <item>*Technical infrastructure for delivery and interoperability </item>
          <item> *Usability </item>
          <item> *IPR / Business planning </item>
          <item> *Preservation </item>
          <item>*Others ... ?</item>
        </list>
        <p>There are plenty of these skills currently existing in the digital humanities world.
          Other bodies (e.g. TASI, ULCC) could be included as needs be.</p>
        <p>I imagine the network to be a loose arrangement of centres; sometimes they will be in
          competition, other times they will be working in collaboration. No one centre should
          monopolise any given area. However, every centre should not try and do all of the above -
          they should develop expertise and capabilities in the areas they are strongest.</p>
        <p>An important issue will to get recognition from funders that potential projects should be
          working with these centres - funding bodies can either encourage or require institutions
          to work with the accredited centres that they feel they can best work with.</p>
        <p>Centre should be strongly advised to work cross-sectorally, particularly with cultural
          heritage institutions.</p>
        <p>Centres may not be a good word to use if there is more than one of them!</p>

        <p>Thanks Lou for your extensive review. Most helpful.</p>
        <p>Stephen Emmott, in a keynote at the Oxford eResearch conference 2 weeks ago had some
          interesting comments about eResearch and the grand challenges of Science in the 21st
          Century. Some of these challenges include the energy crisis, atmospheric changes, and the
          risk of global pandemics. Computational power and infrastructures are needed to address
          these challenges.</p>
        <p>It often surprised me that the British humanities shy away from similar grand challenges.
          Surely there are big questions that the humanities in Britain have a duty to address? And
          perhaps these grand challenges need large scale computational resources or infrastructure
          to do so?</p>
        <p>A network of centres could form around such questions. Economic re-structuring and social
          unrest are hardly new to Europeans. Conflict over resources are hardly new to Europeans.
          Even the decimation of bourgeois infrastructures are hardly new to Europeans; we spent a
          good part of a Century arguing over this one.</p>
        <p>What are the grand challenges of Humanities scholarship? What are some of the grand
          questions of humanities scholarship in the 21st Century? Who are dealing with them? How
          can a network like this help? These aren't trivial questions?</p>
        <p>best,</p>
        <p>Craig</p>
