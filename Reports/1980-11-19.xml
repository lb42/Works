   <head type="event">Data Management: an ICL User Group Conference</head>
   <head type="location">Cavendish Hotel,Eastbourne.</head>
   <head type="when"> 19-21 November 1980</head>
   <p>The keynote of these
proceedings was ICL Hospitality, a curious commodity which was
supplied in various forms and large quantities at regular
intervals. Forms in which ICL Hospitality is supplied include
psychedelic slide shows, online demonstrations and outbursts of
fervent patriotism, but it usually comes in a bottle. The patriotism
was largely concentrated in my first encounter with Dr Peter Aylett
who, perhaps feeling rather tired and emotional after paying for so
much ICL Hospitality, embraced me warmly before the proceedings began
and then tore my ear off for having mentioned some disquiet with the
current serviceability of our 2980. This to the point of alarming an
innocent bystander from RACAL.</p>
   <p>The next day's presentations
might be divided into three categories: polemic (Aylett, Ellis),
apologetic (the three user presentations) and summary (the rest). Of
the user presentations (as one delegate rather sharply pointed out),
one only used data management techniques because of deficiencies in
VME/B (Murphy), one had a user population most of whom had no data to
manage (Burnard) and the other had written their own DBMS and was now
regretting it (Philbrick) . Murphy's account of the problems of
managing the literally thousands of megabytes of data pouring from the
monitoring devices used in fusion experiments at Culham, had a
familiar ring to it. IDMSX is used to keep track of their file usage
and archiving facilities, while they plan to use STATUS to analyse the
free format documentation about the various experiments which
accumulates at roughly the same rate as the data. Apart from
Liverpool, Oxford was the only university site represented; my own
presentation therefore concentrated on the peculiarities of the
University Computing Environment, concerning which I waxed so eloquent
that I had just about reached the topic of data management when the
chairman started waving blue cards at me. Sun Life Assurance's
experience having written their own DBMS confirmed the popular wisdom
- it had taken them 5 man years or so to replace an existing
conventional system, and the replacement was already
inadequate.</p>
   <p>ICL speakers on this first day were perhaps
forgiveably rather desultory in their presenta tions of DDS, TPMS,
IDMS, PDS and the wholesome nature of data management. Harry Ellis
explained how proper use of the products would keep our respective
companies' names out of the papers; Richard Barker rushed through the
recovery and security aspects of IDMS; Yvette Ascher managed to
summarise the facilities of DDS, TPMS and IDMS in a record-breaking 45
minutes and Jackie Sansom did her best to make sense of PDS without
once mentioning the word 'relational'. Apart from PDS itself
(concerning which I made a lot of interested noises in what I hope
were the right places), the chief new departure I noted was a greater
stress on the integration of the products, typified by the merging of
TP with IDMS now known as TPMS, and in the new acrobuzz IPA. This has
nothing to do with pale ale but is short for INFORMATION PROCESSING
ARCHITECTURE. Unlike most machine architectures, this is really a
question of how you feel about what you're doing. If you see a
computer system dynamically as information flowing between nodes
(e,g. terminals, databases, processors) of comparatively less
intrinsic interest, then you are into IPA; if however you see it just
as a machine you are trying to kick into life to do something for you
(and never mind the rest of the world), then you are probably not. The
definition is however mine and may well be quite wrong.</p>
   <p>In the
evening ICL Hospitality took the shape of an excellent dinner
(starring beef Wellington) followed by speeches of increasing
incoherence and a general rush for the bar. I apologised to various
ICL speakers for having run out of time before getting round to saying
just how marvellous the 2% of our users who use IDMS think it
is. Large amounts of malt whisky fuelled further discussions with
assorted ICL directors and Jim Alty long into the night, the exact
nature of which eludes me; data management was not excluded from them,
but the younger generation, Liverpool football club and L. Van
Beethoven also made guest appearances.</p>

   <p>Next morning, at 9 sharp, in body if not
spirit, we reconvened for the unacceptable face of ICL Hospitality in
the form of a half hour long slideshow, complete with music, special
effects and a commentator who would have been more persuasive selling
soap. It resembled nothing so much as an animated glossy brochure from
which, had I been more awake, a fine bag of trophies for pseuds corner
might have been gathered. Its gist was that ICL Computers (information
Processors, sorry) will save you money, increase productivity and make
you irresistible to the opposite sex. The company's latest offerings
(2956 and 2966) slotted sharply into some unexplained scale of
competitiveness next to IBM's most recent offering and on them (after
DME and VME) you could now have CME which could be both, or either. A
delegate later proposed the Friendly User Machine Environment (FUME)
as the obvious next development.</p>
   <p>Fortunately the remaining ICL
presentations were of quite a different nature. Hamish Carmichael gave
an impressively thorough and technically detailed account of CAFS
which, by moving intelligence from the main frame to a file access
component (a 'back end processor'), allows quite staggering
improvements in throughput when large volumes of loosely organised
data are to be searched. ICL's own personnel records are now held on a
CAFS-based system as a slightly modified IMS database; the heretical
implication that IMS storage structures could actually be improved
upon was neither stressed nor shirked. Bob Gifford's presentation of
ICL's experimentation with Viewdata was also quite impressive, if only
because it explained just what is going on during those odd pauses
when one phones SMC about a bug. At present Viewdata access to the
Known Errors Database is only available "in house" or to some selected
foreign sites; several delegates were sufficiently impressed by its
speed to request that it be provided on a Public viewdata
service. Finally, Jim Alty gave a stirring summary of why data
management was a Good Thing and laid into various popular fictions
about it with enviable assurance. He also asserted that Liverpool
currently supported 26 database applications, but later reduced the
figure somewhat.</p>
   <p>Apart from confirmation of every suspicion that
OUCS is a very untypical VME/B user and from an intriguing insight
into how the rest of the world does things, it cannot honestly be said
that my attendance at this gathering was of much direct benefit to the
Service. It was however almost entirely funded by ICL (gratitude for
which is hereby expressed) and something might just come of my noises
about PDS. And maybe universities have a duty to remind the rest of
the world about what they are up to while it is busy making money,
saluting the flag and making programmers redundant.</p>
