The SGML Users Group is an informal pressure group with (as yet)
a fairly small membership drawn largely from software vendors,
universities and the publishing industry. It distributes a useful 
Newsletter containing SGML-related news, product annoucements
etc., organises regular meetings, of which this was presumably
typical and is entitled to sell standards documents at a knock-
down price to members only.

Nigel Bray, md of the British end of a Dutch software house
consultancy  called MID Information Logistics Group Ltd, spoke
first. MID distribute and support Datalogics products, which are
targetted on large scale publishing requirements, typically
involving lots of pictures, publications often derived from an
online database and much revision. He described in some detail
products called WriterStation and Pager and gave an overview of
the production process using such systems. WriterStation is a
conventional word processor running under MS/DOS except that it
knows about document type definitions (DTDs) against which it
validates input, inserting SGML tags as appropriate, and which
are also used by its context-sensitive editor. The DTD for a
given application is held in a sort of runtime module called  the
type definition file; a similar runtime file is used to provide a
viewing format for the text. The latter uses only standard PC
facilities and is thus some way short of WYSWYG, but still
provides helpful (and tag-free) visual feedback to the user. It
does not support any character set other than the standard IBM
set. Pager is a batch pagination system, which can integrate
text produced by WriterStation with graphic images of all kinds
via a GREP look-alike rather optimistically described as an
"omniscient conversion system". This lead to some discussion of
the problems of converting from other typesetting markups to SGML
(a process the chairman characterised as "fundamentally akin to
alchemy") and much bickering from the floor about how (for
example) such systems could possibly handle tables and diagrams.
In conclusion, Bray remarked that a typical system should support
input and maintenance of text via SGML workstations into a
database management system (he mentioned particularly DM and
Oracle), which could provide job tracking and page control
facilities as well as the ability to restructure text into
different presentations. Publication on paper or even on CD-ROM
was no longer seen as the primary purpose of such systems.

This was followed by an intriguing (if rather pointless)
discussion about the feasibility of using SGML to mark up
mathematical text in a meaningful way given by Paul Ellison from
Exeter University's Computing Centre. He is active on the BSI
Technical Committee dealing with text and office systems, which
is currently reviewing among other things Clause (i.e. chapter) 8
of the current ISO Technical Reference paper 9573 Techniques for
using SGML. This aims to produce a DTD capable of dealing with
mathematics. He began (as SGML presentations tend to) by
attempting to answer the question "Why not use TeX?",
immediately conceding that if the object of the exercise was a
document in the house-style preferred by the American Math
Society, there was really nothing to be gained by not using TeX.
If however continuity of markup was desired, and suitability for
a syntax-directed editor, and especially if the markup was to
reflect something of the computability of the mathematics, then
an accurate DTD would surely be preferable, despite its
verbosity, of which he gave ample illustration. As a
mathematical ignoramus I was reassured to find that written
mathematics contains almost as many ambiguities as written
English: for example x with a little n to the right and slightly
above it could mean x &lt;power&gt; n or x &lt;superscript&gt; n; and dx
above dy with a line between does not represent a fraction of
some sort. It was suggested that coping with this was a
particular instance of something more general, dubbed by Ellison
"the secretary problem" - TeX had (after all) been designed for
use by mathematicians.  Mike Clarke (Imperial) remarked that
Mathematica provided means of solving all of these problems and
could be made to generate SGML, but did not elaborate.

Over lunch, I re-met a Dutch acquaintance called Gerd Van Der
Steen, formerly attached to the University of Amsterdam where he
had been developing parsing systems for historical (and other)
documents, who now works for the Dutch end of MID. After lunch,
Martin Bryan (SOBEMAP) stepped into the breach left by the
defection of one of the advertised speakers (Neil Morley) who
was to have spoken on the subject "What the Publishers
Association is doing about SGML". Since this appears to be "not a
lot", this was not probably not too tasking; a booklet
introducing the concepts of SGML had just been distributed to all
PA members; unlike the American Association of Publishers no DTD
specification was envisaged, but publishers were recommended to
use a recently published book (by Bryan as it happens) SGML: an
authors guide as a source for models. Something called a
"management awareness campaign" was also underway.

The last speaker of the day, a M. Moricon from a French software
house called Advanced Information Systems, had expected to be
invited to speak on hypertext and SGML but (due to another last
minute defection) had to prefix this with a brief rundown of
events in France. The French Publishers Association had set up a
working group chaired by Dominique Vignot, which had taken the
AAP's DTD and translated and adapted it for the French market.
Some major publishers (Lefevre, Hachette) and printers (Maury,
Jouve) were known to be using SGML. The French Electricity Board
was reportedly considering its use as a way of coping with the
tons of documentation relating to the Nuclear Energy programme;
the scientific community was also interested but not at a
sufficiently high level to enforce standards.  Of more interest
than this third hand gossip was the remainder of the presentation
in which Moricon talked about the conversion of the CSTB's
Building regulations into an SGML-based hypertext. These
regulations, which have statutory force in France, are being
converted from printed form to an electronic database, from which
they can be extracted for printing or excerpting as well as
electronic browsing in a hypertext published on CD. There is
about 15 Mb of running text, into which tags will be
automatically introduced by a combination of YACC and LEX
(rapidly) and then corrected manually (slowly). A prototype
hypertext had been developed from some sample entries using
Hypercard, modified in some unexplained way to support buttons in
scrolling fields. The experience had shown that it was quite
difficult to get trained drafters of document to understand the
difference between implicit and explicit `anchorage' of sections;
that SGML tagsets making extensive use of attributes required a
lot of complex programming; that a DTD created with hypertext in
mind was a good way of identifying all potential linkages; that
SGML was useful as a way of defining data entry conventions; that
because a DTD identified semantic components it was analogous to
an information model.

In a final roundup of European SGML events, Martin Bryan
mentioned a recent EEC-funded training session held at Ghent.
SGML training should aim to satisfy three distinct groups:
management, end-users and document designers. The latter group
required similar skills to those needed in database design or
systems analysis. A special interest group of the working group
was being set up concerned with the interface between SGML and
databases proper, in which I expressed an interest.
