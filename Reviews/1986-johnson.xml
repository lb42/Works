Dear Gordon
 
  Thank you for giving me the chance to tone down the following review
rather than bowdlerising it yourself!  Just to put the record
straight, I am fully aware of Coppen's status and reputation; my
reference to breakfast was not intended to be derogatory but simply to
point to the way in which such conferences yoke together the oddest of
bedfellows. However, as this point clearly failed to come across, I
have tried to do better below. Thank you for putting me right on the
Nebraskans: they certainly read more like recently fledged BAs than
Senior Lecturers. I have taken no notice of your attempt to change my
punctuation: the double quotes indicate words quoted from the original
I note you dont mind me being rude about Messrs Susskind & Strange, so
have continued so to be. I beg to differ as to whether ICON is ICON or
Icon: you as editor have the privilege of the last word on that as on
the rest.
 
ever yours
 
 
  
 
p.p. "Slasher" Burnard

<p>This trim volume contains 11 papers revealing an extraordinary range
both in computing expertise and in application area. Of the more
widely interesting papers, it should be noted that one is not about
SNOBOL and another is not about English.  In his preface, Eric Johnson
assures us that he at least has "never attended a conference where the
conversations were so animated and engrossing". While warmly welcoming
the advent of this new international forum, this reviewer is tempted
to ascribe at least some of its animation to sheer mutual
astonishment. What common ground can exist between say Peter-Arno
Coppen (Catholic University of Nijmegen) and Wayne Tosh (St Cloud
State University)?  Coppen describes GRASP, a parser-generator for
context-free grammars which happens to be written in SNOBOL. Tosh's
describes a number of undergraduate exercises which also happen to be
written in SNOBOL. Both authors regard SNOBOL as an appropriate
teaching vehicle, but the disparity between what is being taught is so
extreme as to cast doubts as to the existence of any point of contact
other than the accidental identity of the chosen language.
</p>
<p>It is equally hard to imagine any common ground between Ronald
Susskind of the Antares Corporation in Minnesota, and William
C. Strange of the University of Oregon's English department. Without
undue disrespect, Mr Susskind's style leaves me gasping for breath,
but as I understand it, the tenor of his argument is that the English
language itself can be interpreted as if it contained only logical
statements, provided the notion of what constitues logic is "slightly"
extended (it could also be said to consist of purple anxieties,
similar licence permitted, but let that pass).  Mr Strange, writing at
a more even speed, contributes some good old fashioned practical
criticism of three concrete or, in Strange's phrase, "computable"
poems, leading him to the extraordinary and unsubstantiated assertion
that "Poems and programs are surprisingly alike".
</p>
<p>Surely more typical of SNOBOL's current user population are two
workmanlike contributions about real life applications of the
language, one from Paul Bantzer (Startext GmbH, Bonn) about its
usefulness in a photo-typesetting application, the other from Timothy
Montler (North Texas SU) describing a whole suite of programs
developed to assist in the linguistic analysis of a Northwest American
Indian language corpus. The latter is particularly impressive, and
deserves to be better known.  The book begins, as is only appropriate,
with two contributions from Ralph Griswold, one, tantalisingly short,
on the history of the language (which reveals that it was originally
called SEXI for String Expression Interpreter) and the other
describing ICON which, if people were as logical as their tools, will
surely replace SNOBOL as effectively as the transistor replaced the
thermionic valve.
</p>
<p> People being people, however, it seems probable that new
generations will continue to cut their programming teeth on this
magnificently eccentric and dangerously powerful language. Hard
evidence of this continuity is provided not just by two earnest
contributions from recent academic converts to SNOBOL at the
University of Nebraska but also in the new SNOBOL and SPITBOL systems
available for microcomputers. Only one of these (Catspaw's SNOBOL4+)
is mentioned here, in the context of some interactive debugging
utilities, the code for which is the most substantial part of Mark
Emmer's paper. It would be interesting to see some comparison between
the performance and facilities of the various SPITBOLs and SNOBOLs now
available on small machines; perhaps this will come in ICEBOL 86,
which we are assured will also take place in Madison, South Dakota.

ICEBOL 85 (Proceedings of the 1985 International Conference on English Language 
and Literature Applications of SNOBOL and SPITBOL, edited by Eric Johnson, 
Dakota State College)
 
This trim volume contains 11 papers, of which, without exerting excessive 
charity, only three could be regarded as of more than purely local interest. 
Moreover, one of these is not about Snobol and another is not about English 
language or literature. One can only assume that the event itself had 
compensatory  advantages; its organiser assures us that he at least has "never 
attended a conference where the conversations were so animated and engrossing". 
Judging by the enormous disparities in expertise and attitudes to computing 
revealed in the papers here published, some of this animation might be 
attributable to sheer mutual astonishment.  One can only speculate as to the 
breakfast-time  conversations between say Peter-Arno Coppen (Catholic 
University of Nijmegen) and Wayne Tosh  (St Cloud State University). Coppen's 
paper describes GRASP, a parser-generator for context-free grammars which 
happens to be written in Spitbol. Tosh's describes a number of undergraduate 
exercises which also happen to be written in Spitbol. Both authors regard 
Spitbol as an appropriate teaching vehicle, but the disparity between what is 
being taught is so extreme as to cast doubts as to the existence of any point 
of contect other than the accidental identity  of the chosen language.
In the same way, this reviewer would have liked to be privy to any conversation 
between Ronald Sussman of the Antares Corporation in Minnesota, and William C. 
Strange of the University of Oregon's English department. Without undue 
disrespect, Mr Sussman's style leaves me gasping for breath, but as I 
understand it, the tenor of his argument is that the English language itself 
can be interpreted as if it contained only logical statements, provided the 
notion of what constitues logic is "slightly" extended (it could also be said 
to consist of purple anxieties, similar licence permitted, but let that pass). 
Mr Strange, writing  at a more even speed, contributes some good old fashioned 
practical criticism  of three concrete or, in Strange's phrase, "computable" 
poems, leading him to the extraordinary and unsubstantiated assertion that 
"Poems and programs are surprisingly alike".
 
Surely more typical of SNOBOL's current user population are two workmanlike 
contributions about real life applications of the language, one from Paul 
Bantzer (Startext GmbH, Bonn) about its usefulness in a photo-typesetting 
application, the other from Timothy Montler (North Texas SU) describing a whole

transistor replaced the thermionic valve.
 
 People being people, however, it seems probable that new generations will 
continue to cut their programming teeth on this magnificently eccentric and 
dangerously powerful language. Hard evidence of this continuity is provided not 
just by two somewhat embarassingly earnest contributions by recent graduates of 
the University of Nebraska but also in the new SNOBOL and SPITBOL systems 
available for microcomputers. Only one of these (Catspaw's SNOBOL4+) is 
mentioned here, in the context of some interactive debugging utilities, the

will come in ICEBOL 86, which we are assured will also take place in Madison, 
South Dakota.
