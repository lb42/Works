    <head>Defining hermeneutics</head>
    <p>The word <emph>hermeneutics</emph> has a long and informative history. In exploring its
     senses, as for those of other unfamiliar words, we might begin by recourse to a dictionary: the
     <emph>Shorter Oxford</emph> for example informs us that hermeneutics is <q>the art or science
     of interpretation, esp. of Scripture. Commonly dist. from exegesis or practical exposition.</q>
     The lexicographer who composed that entry seems to have been more than usually cautious — are
     we dealing with an art or a science here? Is hermeneutics really best defined by contrast, as
     something inherently impractical (unlike, presumably, the eminently practical pursuit of
     biblical exegesis)? The meaning of a word is often more than can be summed up by a
     lexicographer, however cautious or eminent. Learned words like this one frequently carry with
     them senses more directly derived from their etymological roots, and this one is no
     exception.</p>
    <p>In Greek myth, Hermes was the mediator responsible for explaining the messages of the gods to
     mere mortals, hence the Greek word <emph>hermeneus</emph>, an interpreter. In Egypt his
     identity was merged with that of Thoth, the god of arcane knowledge and wisdom who later, in
     the shape of Hermes Trismegistus (Hermes the thrice-powerful), is credited with authorship of
     the hermetic scriptures in which all knowledge is embodied. The notion that all knowledge can
     be encapsulated in written texts, from which it may be recovered only by dint of divine
     mediation, is thus a very ancient one. It is also very modern: we see it in the seductive myth
     of the all-inclusive <soCalled>virtual library</soCalled>, and also in the ways we privilege
     certain modes of interaction with text (<soCalled>scholarship</soCalled>) above others
     (<soCalled>reading</soCalled>). A distinguishing feature of scholarship (as opposed to mere
     reading) seems to be provision of access to (or evidence of) the hermetic knowledge preserved
     by the hermeneutic tradition, made tangible in print form by such characteristically academic
     modes of discourse as the monograph, the footnote, or the critical edition. This association
     with the arcane seems particularly appropriate in a term which appears most frequently in the
     British National Corpus as an example of a word which is hard or impossible to understand.</p>
    <p>What is incomprehensible for a secular rationalist is often revelatory for a mystic, and it
     is surely no coincidence therefore that we find a quasi-mystical paradox at the heart of much
     thinking about hermeneutics: we read, for example, of the <emph>hermeneutic circle</emph>, an
     intrinsically mystical notion, derived from the observation that to understand a part, its
     function in the whole must be clear; yet the function of the whole can only be derived from an
     understanding of its parts. Every explication thus becomes at once an exploration of the other,
     while remaining at the same time as a project of self-discovery.</p>
    <p>Viewed historically, the focus of hermeneutics shifts from the divine to the secular, in
     tandem with that of society as a whole. If the business of hermeneutics for the 18th century
     and beyond was largely confined to biblical exegesis, under the influence of theorists such as
     Schleirmacher and Dilthey, it has become by the end of the 19th century the basis of a general
     methodology for the humanities.</p>
    <p>In attempts to explicate how interpretations <emph>work</emph>, we see a similar shift from
     the presupposition of some kind of universal empathy (characteristic of 19th century
     romanticism) to a more linguistically-based notion of universal pragmatism, characteristic of
     20th century philosophies of discourse and social interaction. In our own time, we now find the
     term applied in fields such as medicine (which talks of a hermeneutic approach to nursing) and
     social anthropology, as well as the more predictable and profound role it plays in linguistics.
     Like that other hard word <emph>ontology</emph>, it cannot be long before we find it entering
     in the technical vocabulary of computer science and natural language processing.</p>
    <p>This is surely because, in the post-modern and post-structuralist world, hermeneutics has
     become a key part of what might be termed cultural cognition. Cultural objects do not simply
     require an interpretation, it is the act of bestowing that interpretation which validates their
     status as cultural objects in the first place. Texts, and other artefacts alike, are invested
     with meaning by our use of them, and it is therefore interpretation alone which confers value
     on them. Small wonder that Derrida, citing Montaigne, takes it as self-evident that <q>We need
     to interpret interpretations more than to interpret things</q>.</p>
    <p>If hermeneutics is the study of interpretation itself, it seems useful to investigate the
     goals of that process. What is the object of the hermeneutic process? Many of those goals seem
     to have been discredited by current thinking: we no longer see the objective of our analysis as
     being to uncover an eternal verity. In the more restricted world of literary criticism, we have
     seen such goals as the establishment of authorial intention, of the original authentic context,
     or the effect on an ideal reader, all become increasingly unfashionable. This is only partly
     because the observer effect (still a novelty in the sciences but central to the humanities)
     begs the question as to whose interpretation it is we are seeking to apply. There is ample
     evidence that not all interpretations are equally useful or have equal explanatory force, yet
     on what grounds do we decide which interpretations can be disregarded?</p>
    <p>The British semiotician Daniel Chandler remarks somewhere: <q>We cannot write
     <soCalled>without bias</soCalled>, but we can learn to become more aware of our biases, to make
     them more explicit for others, and to reflect critically on their implications.</q> This is an
     aim which tends to distinguish social science from such arts as literary criticism. Although
     most literary critics of my acquaintance might probably wish to question the implied slur of
     the latter sentence, they would generally endorse the force of the former.</p>
    <p>It is an odd characteristic of the way we currently deal with our written heritage that,
     despite the debunking of author-ity, the canon remains alive and well in the marketplace. We
     may no longer identify literature exclusively with the production of dead white European males;
     instead however we create new canonical collections, of pop culture, of Afro-American
     literature, of women's writing. Canonicity itself, the desire to catch the whole of some class
     of valued cultural phenomena often defined by exclusion, seems inescapable.</p>
    <p>A curious enthusiasm surrounds us for reconstructions of imagined past times, whether in the
     fad for music performed on<soCalled>authentic</soCalled> instruments, or in unthinking
     reactions against modernism in architecture. I suggest this antiquarianism is also at the root
     of our contemporary desire to value the reproduction of allegedly primary textual sources,
     unmediated by the skill of the textual critic. My point here is not to suggest that such
     activities are worthless but simply to call into question their ostensive claim to a higher
     purer reality. This seems to me (as it once did to Pope) to be dignifying antiquarianism with a
     higher purpose. Wittgenstein reminds us that if lions could talk we would not understand them:
     we should equally bear in mind that even if we could go back to the first night of <emph>King
     Lear</emph> at the Globe we would not be able to erase from our memories all the three hundred
     years' interpretation of that text which have intervened or if we could, it would be at the
     loss of our own identity.</p>
    <p>A vigorous scepticism thus remains necessary. We would do well to bear in mind the
     etymological connection between the words <soCalled>text</soCalled> and
     <soCalled>textile</soCalled>, between what is written and what is woven. Every text should be
     seen as a tissue of explication, reacted against or reaffirmed, in the light of a continued
     tension between continuity and tradition, the driving force of this particular loom. It is part
     of the nature of (for example) women's writing that it has been systematically undervalued at
     several periods of history.</p>
    <p>The hermeneutic act thus seems to have a crucial role in mediating and determining our
     experience of cultural objects. In selecting interpretations of such objects, we seek to
     explain those others who created them but also to explain ourselves and our tangled reactions
     to them. In this complex business, hermeneutics has an important social function, not simply in
     broadening and enriching individual experience of the world, but also in motivating social
     coherence and social change. It is at the very heart of humanism, and of human society.</p>

   <div>
    <head>Text, textuality, encoding</head>
    <p>One suggestive insight gained by investigating the difference between speech and writing
     seems to be the extent to which both forms of text seem to depend on semiotic systems beyond
     their immediate constituents. In speech, contextual features such as the relationship of the
     speakers to each other or their surroundings have at least as important an explicative role as
     what they actually say. In writing, the physical appearance of a text, the medium by which it
     is presented, and its audience's expectations of such forms are of equally great significance.
     (Some have even famously asserted that the<q>medium is the message</q>). It is not for purely
     technical reasons therefore that we require of scholarship an understanding of the relationship
     between the technologies of text and their application, as well as the historical results of
     that process.</p>
    <p>In this section I focus on the semiotic aspects of hermeneutics, in the specific field of
     text encoding. I begin with a brief attempt to identify key characteristics of the coding
     systems associated with texts, whether these may be said to exist within, behind, or amongst,
     texts.</p>
    <p>It seems self evident that a text has at least three major axes along which we may attempt to
     analyse it, and thus at least three interlocking semiotic systems. A text is simultaneously an
     image (which may be transferred from one physical instance to another, by various imaging
     techniques); a linguistic construct (which may equally be encoded using different modalities,
     as when a written text is performed); and an information structure (it has semantic content
     relating to a perception of the world at large). It may be noteworthy that these three
     dimensions seem also to be reflected in three different kinds of software: word processing
     software focussing on the appearance of text, text retrieval software focussing on its
     linguistic components, and database systems focussing on its <soCalled>meaning</soCalled>.</p>
    <p>Texts and their meanings are not however to be constrained by the capabilities of software.
     They remain defiantly both linguistic and physical objects; their formal organisation may seem
     to be linear but is generally not, being characterised by multiple hierarchic structures and
     interlinked components. Moreover, as cultural objects, they are at once products of and
     definers of specific <emph>contexts</emph>. By <emph>context</emph> I mean here not simply a
     consideration of the agency carrying intellectual responsibility for a text, but also its
     intended, presumed, or actual audience, its intended or assumed function, and so forth. And in
     a highly textualised society such as ours, no text is an island: an important aspect of any
     text is thus the properties it shares with other texts, the reference it makes to itself and to
     others, its inter-textuality. The same is true of the <emph>readings</emph> of texts.</p>
    <p>The scope and variety of the encoding systems we need to envisage in developing a unified
     account of the way that hermeneutics works in texts may thus seem very large indeed. The claim
     of this paper is, however, that a unified approach remains feasible. As an example, we consider
     a much studied piece of parchment, sometimes known as MS Cotton Vitellius A xv, a rather poor
     representation of the start of which appears below: <figure>
     <graphic url="beowulf-ms.png"/>
     <head>Image of the first few lines of MS Cotton Vitellius A xv</head>
     </figure></p>
    <p>What exactly is going on when we process this image, when we make an interpretation of it?
     Clearly, there is a mapping process in which the various visual signals here are classified as
     either irrelevant noise or as signifiers of some kind — as letters, punctuation, decoration,
     and so on. A scholarly reading goes further, identifying not just discrete letter forms, but
     also forms which appear to be discrete but are in fact common variants of each other (such as
     upper and lower case, italic and bold, etc). Structural signifiers — the use of white space
     between words, in this example — must also be identified. Not to labour the obvious, it is
     interesting to note that in a printed or written text the mapping between signifier and
     signified is fixed and conventional: though it may become inaccessible or misunderstood, it is
     not inherently flexible.</p>
    <p>Here then, is one fixed reading of the above text (based on Wrenn's edition of 1953):<q
     rend="display">
     <l>Hw&#x00E6;t! we Gar-Dena in gear-dagum</l>
     <l>&#x00FE;eod-cyninga &#x00FE;rym gefrunon,</l>
     <l>hu &#x00F0;a &#x00E6;&#x00FE;elingas ellen fremedon.</l>
     <l>Oft Scyld Scefing scea&#x00FE;ena &#x00FE;reatum,</l>
     <l n="5">monegum m&#x00E6;g&#x00FE;um meodo-setla ofteah;</l>
     <l>egsode Eorl[e], sy&#x00F0;&#x00F0;an &#x00E6;rest wear&#x00F0;</l>
     <l>feasceaft funden&#x2026;</l> </q></p>
    <p>In this printed rendition, white space and lineation are used to flag explicitly the
     boundaries of metrical units (lines, stanzas, and even the hemistiches of Old English verse)
     not actually explicit in the manuscript. These units are the result of an act of
     interpretation; they both represent and determine a particular reading. The particular mapping
     chosen for each visual signal is informed by expectation, convention, and often somewhat arcane
     knowledge: we call this <emph>transcription</emph>, or <emph>editing</emph> and it is, I
     contend, the first step in a hermeneutic continuum. For many scholars, better experienced than
     I, the distinction between transcription and editing is a clear one, largely defined by
     differing goals. Transcription aims to represent the actual object, while editing aims to
     represent an idealised version of the object, which may never have existed in physical form. It
     seems to me, however, that while these goals may be clearly distinguishable, the processes by
     which they are achieved seem strikingly similar, involving the same essentially interpretative
     relationship between the agent/reader and the object/text. This is particularly evident in the
     process of making a digital transcription. A digital transcription comes about as the result of
     applying a fixed selection from the many possible interpretive strategies which might be
     applied, effectively reifying the mapping chosen. Before a text can be encoded, it must first
     be decoded. This decoding process implies a selection from the many features implicit in the
     reading of a text, and their re-encoding in explicit and unambiguous terms.</p>
    <p>For example, we might choose to encode the manuscript lines above in either of the two
     following ways (amongst many others)<eg><![CDATA[ 
<lg><l>Hw&#x00E6;t we Gar-Dena in gear-dagum</l> 
<l>&#x00FE;eod-cyninga &#x00FE;rym gefrunon,</l> 
<l>hu &#x00F0;a &#x00E6;&#x00FE;elingas ellen fremedon.<l></lg> 
<lg><l>Oft Scyld Scefing scea&#x00FE;ena &#x00FE;reatum,</l> 
<l>monegum m&#x00E6;g&#x00FE;um meodo-setla ofteah; </l> 
<l>egsode Eorle, sy&#x00F0;&#x00F0;an &#x00E6;rest wear&#x00F0;</l> 
<l>feasceaft funden&#x2026; ]]></eg> </p>
    <p>In this version, letter forms are normalised, by means of entity references where necessary,
     and spacing is silently normalised. Most strikingly however, the metrical structure is made
     explicit by the addition of tags which mark the boundaries of verse lines and stanzas. Much
     information about the original lineation and rendition is lost, but much information not
     explicitly present in the original is added. Contrast this with the following encoding:<eg><![CDATA[<lb n="1"/><hi rend='caps'>&H;&wynn;&aelig;t we garde</hi> na 
<lb n="2"/>in gear-dagum &#x00FE;eod cyninga 
<lb n="3"/>&#x00FE;rym ge frunon hu&#x00F0;a  
&#x00E6;&#x00FE;elinga&amp;s; ellen 
<lb n="4"/>fremedon. oft scyld scefing 
scea&#x00FE;e <add>na</add> 
<lb n="5"/>&#x00FE;reatum, moneg <expan sic=&amp;ubar;>um</expan> 
m&#x00E6;g&#x00F0;um meodo-setla 
<lb n="6"/>of <damage desc=blot>teah egsode <sic corr=Eorle>eorl</sic> 
sy&#x00F0;&#x00F0;an &#x00E6;rest wear&#x00F0; 
<lb n="7"/>feasceaft funden&#x2026; ]]></eg> </p>
    <p>In this second version, a rather different set of decisions has been taken. Again, the
     individual characters and interword spacing have been normalised, though the linguistically
     invisible space between <soCalled>ge</soCalled> and<soCalled>frunon</soCalled> has here been
     made explicit and a slightly larger set of entity references has been used to make explicit
     some extra characters such as the peculiar initial <soCalled>H</soCalled> and the wynn
     following it. The lineation of the original has been represented explicitly using the
     &lt;lb&gt; tag, to which numbering has been added for convenience of reference, and the use of
     uppercase for the first few words has been made explicit. Moreover, letters not visible because
     of damage to the carrier (such as the<soCalled>na</soCalled> needed at the end of the fourth
     line) or manuscript convention (such as the <soCalled>um</soCalled> of
     <soCalled>monegum</soCalled> indicated in the manuscript by the breve mark) have been added,
     together with an explicit indication of their status by means of the &lt;add&gt; and
     &lt;expan&gt; tags respectively. The presence of an inkblot is signalled by the &lt;damage&gt;
     tag, and the &lt;corr&gt; tag has been used to make explicit a fairly non-controversial but
     still conjectural editorial emendation (<soCalled>Eorle</soCalled> for
     <soCalled>eorl</soCalled> in line 5).</p>
    <p>Neither of these digital versions is in any sense<soCalled>wrong</soCalled> or even
     necessarily <soCalled>superior</soCalled> to the other: they merely reflect differing
     priorities, differing research agendas, and consequently differing <emph>markup
     schemes</emph>.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <head>The scope of markup</head>
    <p>The term <soCalled>markup</soCalled> covers a range of interpretive acts. Like other semiotic
     systems, markup has its own lexis and its own syntax. The former determines which features are
     available for marking, the latter how those features co-exist; we focus here on the former. It
     seems clear that no violence is done to the term <emph>markup</emph> if we give it a rather
     wide ranging scope.</p>
    <p>We may use it to describe the process by which individual components of a writing or other
     scheme are represented, and for the simple reduction to linear form which digital recording
     requires. We can also use it for the more obvious acts of representing structure and
     appearance, whether original or intended. Markup is also able to represent characterisations
     such as analysis, interpretation, the <emph>affect</emph> of a text, or the contexts in which
     it was or is to be articulated — the metadata associated with it. Since the range of such
     features is now more or less co-extensive with the range of interesting things one might want
     to say, the term is probably in need of some subcategorisation. We therefore propose here three
     broad classes for the myriad textual features which text markup may make explicit:<list
     type="unordered">
     <item>compositional features</item>
     <item>contextual features</item>
     <item>interpretive features</item>
     </list></p>
    <p>Some typical compositional features include the formal structure of a text — its constituent
     sections, chapters, headings etc., as well as its linguistic structure — its constituent
     sentences, clauses, words, morphemes etc. From a different perspective, we might identify as
     compositional features the components of a text's discourse structure — its exchanges, moves,
     acts, etc. A third view concerns itself more with the ontological status of a text's
     composition: its constituent revisions, deletions, additions etc., or its history as a shifting
     nexus of discrete fragments.</p>
    <p>Some typical contextual features include a consideration of the agencies by which a text came
     into being or is identified as such (its author, title, publisher&#x2026;) and of the situation
     in which it is experienced (the intended or actual audience, the mode of performance itself,
     the predefined category of text to which it explicitly or implicitly belongs&#x2026;). Some may
     be identifiable only externally (its subject, text-type, mode), while others are internal
     (size, encoding, revision status)</p>
    <p>Some typical interpretive features include linguistic properties such as morpho-syntactic
     classifications, lemmatisation, sense-disambiguation, identification of particular semantic or
     discourse features, and in general all kinds of annotation and commentary, for example
     associating passages in one text with passages in another, or citing instances of a more
     abstract knowledge structure.</p>
    <p>Despite the convenience of this kind of triage, it has to be stressed that at bottom all
     markup is interpretive. In most encoded texts, features of all three kinds typically co-occur.
     For example, the emendation of <soCalled>eorl</soCalled> to<soCalled>Eorle</soCalled> requires
     an understanding of both morphological information (a plural noun is appropriate) and semantic
     information (the sense<soCalled>prince</soCalled> is inappropriate here); its ontological
     status as an emendation is also important.</p>
    <p>It now should be apparent why the availability of a single encoding scheme, a unified
     semiotic system, is of such importance to the emerging discipline of digital transcription. By
     using a single formalism we reduce the complexity inherent in representing the
     interconnectedness of all aspects of our hermeneutic analysis, and thus facilitate a polyvalent
     analysis.</p>
    <p>Markup has, however, another function, in some ways a more critical one. By making explicit a
     theory about some aspect of a document, markup maps a (human) interpretation of the text into a
     set of codes on which computer processing can be performed. It thus enables us to record human
     interpretations in a mechanically shareable way. The availability of large language corpora
     enables us to improve on impressionistic intuition about the behaviour of language users with
     reference to something larger than individual experience. In rather the same way, the
     availability of encoded textual interpretations can make explicit, and thus shareable, a
     critical consensus about the status of any of the textual features discussed in the previous
     section for a given text or set of texts. It provides an interlingua for the sharing of
     interpretations, an accessible hermetic code.</p>
    <p>If we see digitised and encoded texts as nothing less than the vehicle by which the scholarly
     tradition is to be maintained, questions of digital preservation take on a more than esoteric
     technical interest. And even here, in the world of archival stores and long term digital
     archiving, a consideration of hermeneutic theory is necessary. The continuity of comprehension
     on which scholarship depends implies, necessitates indeed, a continuity in the availability of
     digitally stored information.</p>
    <p>Digital media, however, are notoriously short lived, as anyone who has ever tried to rescue
     last year's floppy disk knows. To ensure that data stored on such media remains usable, it must
     be periodically <soCalled>refreshed</soCalled>, that is, transferred from one medium to
     another. If this copying is done bit for bit, that is, with no intervening interpretation, the
     new copy will be indistinguishable from the original, and thus as usable as the original.</p>
    <p>In that last phrase, however, there lurks a catch. Digital media suffer not only from
     physical decay but also from technical obsolescence. The bits on a disk may have been preserved
     perfectly but if a computer environment (software and hardware) no longer exists capable of
     processing them, they are so much noise. Computer environments have changed out of all
     recognition during the last few years and show no sign of stabilising at any point in the
     future. To ensure that digital data remains comprehensible therefore, simple refreshment of its
     media is not enough. Instead the data must periodically be <soCalled>migrated</soCalled> from
     one computer environment to another. Migration, in this context, is exactly analogous with the
     processes of decoding and encoding carried out by a human being when copying from one stored
     form of a text to another: there is a potential for information loss or transformation in both
     decoding and encoding stages.</p>
    <p>Where digital encoding techniques may perhaps have an advantage over other forms of encoding
     information is in their clear separation of markup and content. As we have seen, the markup of
     a printed or written text may be expressed using a whole range of conventions and expectations,
     often not even physically explicit (and therefore not preservable) in it. By contrast, the
     markup of an electronic text may be carried out using a single semiotic system in which any
     aspect of its interpretation can be made explicit, and therefore preservable. If, moreover,
     this markup uses as metalanguage some scheme which is independent of any particular machine
     environment (for example international standards such as SGML, XML, or ASN1), the migration
     problem is reduced to preservation only of the metalanguage used to describe the markup rather
     than of all its possible applications.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <head>Conclusions</head>
    <p>Far from being peripheral or in opposition to the humanistic endeavour, text encoding and
     markup are central to it. Text encoding provides us with a single semiotic system for
     expressing the huge variety of scholarly knowledge now at our disposal, through which, by means
     of which, and in spite of which, our cultural tradition persists. Text markup is currently the
     best tool at our disposal for ensuring that the hermeneutic circle continues to turn, that our
     cultural tradition endures.</p>
