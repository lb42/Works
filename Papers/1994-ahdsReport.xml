            <p>This document is the Report of a Feasibility Study funded by the Information Systems
               Sub-Committee (ISSC) of the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) of the Higher
               Education Funding Councils. The Study arose out of a Proposal submitted to the
               Committee by the authors of the present report in February 1994.<note>

                        Committee</title>, February 1994.</bibl>
               </note> Support for a feasibility study on this topic was also recommended in the

            <p>The Proposal was also in part prompted by the report of a Humanities Information

            <div xml:id="mssum">
               <head>Summary</head>
               <p>The objective of the Feasibility Study was to consider how a broad and flexible
                     <term>Arts and Humanities Data Service</term> (<name rend="abbr">ahds</name>)
                  might be established, within which the development and use of electronic resources
                  would be both widened and facilitated, while remaining both responsive to change
                  and cost-effective. </p>
               <p>The recommendations of the Feasibility Study may be summarized as follows: <list>
                     <item>the role of an Arts and Humanities Data Service should be to promote
                        effective, low-cost access to the widest range of relevant digital resources
                        by UK researchers and teachers from all Arts and Humanities disciplines; </item>
                     <item>the functions to be performed include: cataloguing and identification of
                        resources; development and application of standards; documentation and
                        training; archival preservation of existing resources; identification and
                        creation of new resources; protection of intellectual property rights; </item>
                     <item>the Arts and Humanities Data Service should have a distributed structure,
                        with some functions being performed by a central infrastructure, and others
                        by co-operating specialist data service providers; </item>
                     <item>the Service should define standard policies with respect to the
                        description and encoding of data resources, their preservation, their
                        dissemination, and a range of ancillary support facilities and services; </item>
                     <item>the Service should invite bids from suitably qualified institutions
                        wishing to provide specific resources within the <name rend="abbr"
                           >ahds</name> infrastructure and define ways in which such service
                        providers may co-operate; </item>
                     <item>initial funding is required for an executive to oversee the process of
                        establishing an organizational framework for the Service, and for a small
                        group of four or five collaborating service providers. These should be
                        chosen by open tender, with a view to covering the areas of textual data,
                        numeric and historical data sets, records of images and artefacts,
                        time-based resources such as music and video; the total budget for the
                        Service envisaged here is likely to fall between 500,000 and one million
                        pounds per annum during the start-up period. </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="msint">
               <head>Outline of the Report </head>
               <p>The remainder of the current section summarizes the principal issues addressed by
                  the Feasibility Study, focusing on its timeliness, the problems it addresses and
                  the solutions proposed. A brief account is also given (in section <ref
                     target="msmodop">1.8 Conduct of the Feasibility Study</ref>) of the
                  consultative process by which the Study was carried out. </p>
               <p>Section <ref target="cu">2 Perceived needs and the current situation</ref>
                  contains a summary overview of institutions, services, and patterns of provision
                  currently obtaining in this area, some of which are described in more detail in
                  Appendix <ref target="ip">8 Institutions and Projects </ref>. This section also
                  includes a discussion of the user needs identified by this study and the way in
                  which those needs are currently met, which is largely derived from the
                  consultative process carried out during the Feasibility Study. </p>
               <p>The Recommendations of the Study are presented under four major headings. In
                  section <ref target="st">3 Scope and Structure of the ahds</ref> the scope of the
                  Service is discussed in terms of disciplines and data types, and the community
                  which is to be served. This section also describes the organizational structure
                  proposed for the Service, together with the functional requirements for its
                  various proposals. The proposals are intended to combine the virtues of both
                  distributed and centralized approaches to the management of resources. </p>
               <p>Section <ref target="sd">4 Standardization </ref> discusses the application of
                  standards within the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>, which form a key element in
                  the scheme proposed here. Section <ref target="is">5 Implementation Strategy
                  </ref> outlines a possible implementation strategy for setting up such a service
                  and section <ref target="co">6 Financial and Costing Considerations</ref> makes
                  some preliminary estimation of the likely costs of the proposed service. </p>

            <div xml:id="msissues1">
               <head>Timeliness and Relevance</head>
               <p>Recent major developments in information technology are beginning to have a
                  significant impact on humanities research and teaching. This is due partly to the
                  appearance of more sophisticated hardware and more appropriate software, but it is
                  above all the rapid spread of local, national and international networks which is
                  now presenting the higher education community with both problems and
                  opportunities. </p>
               <p>The opportunities arise in particular from the rapid increase in the number,
                  variety and accessibility of electronic data sets now being created for research
                  and teaching. Electronic data sets are being produced across the whole range of
                  humanities disciplines, covering both primary and secondary materials in a wide
                  variety of formats text, data, image, sound, and multimedia. At the same time, as
                  a result of institutional information technology strategies, the number of
                  teachers and researchers who are equipped to take advantage of these resources is
                  steadily increasing, as is the recognition of their value in exploratory,
                  resource-based, learning. </p>

            <div xml:id="msissues2">
               <head>Current Problems </head>
               <p>Unfortunately, however, there are a number of problems associated with these
                  developments. These include: <list type="gloss">
                     <label>dependence on specific hardware or software: </label>
                     <item>this makes it hard both to archive data sets effectively and to ensure
                        their long term <term>re-usability</term>, without significant additional
                        costs;</item>
                     <label>inadequate or non-existent documentation: </label>
                     <item>electronic resources are largely unusable without some form of
                        documentation, which is all too often not readily available, either as a
                        result of lack of awareness of the need for it, or because in many areas
                        there are no agreed documentation standards;</item>
                     <label>inadequate resource discovery tools: </label>
                     <item>in the absence of both widely accepted standards for cataloguing such
                        resources and any simple mechanism for searching such catalogues as exist,
                        it is difficult or impossible for individual researchers or teachers to
                        locate existing data sets, or to carry out reliably complete searches
                        through available resources, even with skilled bibliographic
                        assistance;</item>
                     <label>a variety of incompatible complex access tools: </label>
                     <item> because of the wide variety of software mechanisms now used for
                        accessing and manipulating data sets, potential users must acquire a
                        daunting range of information and skills, largely irrelevant to their
                        immediate concerns;</item>
                     <label>insufficient attention to data preservation: </label>
                     <item> in many cases there are no procedures or plans to ensure the long term
                        preservation of the data sets, so that the investment in creating the data
                        set will be wasted;</item>
                     <label>institutional inflexibility:</label>
                     <item>the rapidity with which information technology changes has made it very
                        difficult for existing institutional structures to adapt to new
                        opportunities. Despite widespread recognition of the gradual convergence of
                        library and computing services functions, it remains difficult to integrate
                        the complementary skills of library and computing staff in most
                        institutions. Such integrated expertise is, however, essential for the
                        support of the growing numbers of IT- aware teachers and researchers.</item>

               <head>Proposed Solutions </head>
               <p>This report proposes the establishment of a distributed Arts and Humanities Data
                  Service as a means of both taking full advantage of the opportunities and also
                  addressing the problems. </p>
               <p>Such a Service will need to concern itself with a wide range of activities. We
                  list here a few of the most immediately obvious requirements: <list>
                     <item>identification of user needs;</item>
                     <item>creation and acquisition of data sets;</item>
                     <item>development and promotion of standard data formats;</item>
                     <item>documentation of data sets;</item>
                     <item>development of a comprehensive catalogue of resources;</item>
                     <item>development and promotion of suitable tools for resource discovery and
                        manipulation, both for UK and overseas data sets;</item>
                     <item>archiving of resources;</item>
                     <item>protection of the rights of data providers;</item>
                     <item>provision of user training and support;</item>
                     <item>promotion of the use of data sets in both research and teaching.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Some of these activities might be most effectively provided in a distributed
                  environment, notably those requiring extensive specialist knowledge; others,
                  notably the establishment of standards and the provision of comprehensive resource
                  discovery tools, seem better suited to a centralized infrastructure. </p>
               <p>The present proposal therefore proposes a framework in which a network of
                  autonomous <term>service providers</term> can co-ordinate activities under the
                  direction of a <term>service infrastructure</term>. </p>
               <p>This distributed approach provides the flexibility needed to adjust to a rapidly
                  changing landscape of information provision. The Humanities comprise many
                  widely-divergent disciplines, each with its own highly specialized requirements,
                  but each also highly inter- dependent. The approach proposed here encourages the
                  emergence of a consensus on such issues as standardization of resource description
                  and provision, without imposing a rigid structure. It promotes the development and
                  application of relevant specialist expertise and facilitates the evolution of a
                  service which accurately reflects the real needs of a large community with
                  widely-ranging and diffuse needs. At the same time, the existence of an effective
                  infrastructure allows for significant cost-sharing and the pooling of resources
                  wherever appropriate. </p>
               <p>The proposed Arts and Humanities Data Service will comprise: <list>
                     <item>a <term>Management Committee</term>, acting as liaison between the <name
                           rend="abbr">ahds</name> and its funders, which has final responsibility
                        for the Service;</item>
                     <item>an <term>Executive</term>, with responsibilities for co- ordination of
                           <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>-funded services, policy-making and day to
                        day running of the Service as a whole;</item>
                     <item>a number of <term>Service Providers</term> providing specialist services
                        of various kinds, according to <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>-defined
                        standards.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This report proposes that a small number of such Service Providers be established
                  initially, covering as wide a spread of Arts and Humanities data as possible.
                  Service Providers will typically provide a range of expertise and support
                  appropriate to particular disciplines and data types, building on existing areas
                  of expertise, such as the <name>Computers in Teaching Initiative</name> (see
                  section <ref target="ipcti">8.1.2.4 Source of funding</ref>) and the
                     <name>Teaching and Learning Technology Programme</name>
                  <name rend="abbr">tltp</name> projects, and liaising with relevant existing

                  also specify the extent to which the resource concerned conforms to defined <name

                  and experts within the community. Layered standards will be defined not only for
                  data formats and data description but also for data provision and preservation, as
                  described in section <ref target="sd">4 Standardization </ref> . </p>
               <p>In all aspects of its work, especially policy formulation, the Executive will work

               <p>The report identifies the following benefits resulting from the establishment of a
                  distributed Arts and Humanities Data Service: <list>
                     <item>transferability and re-usability of expensive data resources;</item>
                     <item>a framework for the creation of complementary and linkable data

               </p>
               <p>The establishment of the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> should therefore make a
                  significant contribution to improved efficiency in the conduct of research and the
                  quality of research results. It should also greatly improve the efficiency and
                  quality of teaching and learning facilities within the Higher Education community. </p>
               <p>The proposal is timely, in that it comes at a moment when there is widespread
                  recognition of the scope of the problems which it seeks to address. Its proposals
                  are well-grounded in that they result from a broad-based consultation with a range
                  of expert groups, as well as the specialist knowledge and experience of the
                  Study's authors and Steering Group. </p>

               <head>Financial considerations</head>
               <p>The costs of providing a Service of the type envisaged here are non-trivial. We
                  estimate that service providers will typically need at least two full-time
                  employees, with secretarial support. Assuming adequate institutional support for
                  computing facilities, and for most other aspects of the necessary technical
                  infrastructure, this gives a minimum cost of 80K - 100K per service provider per
                  annum. Where significant institutional support is not forthcoming, the costs of
                  providing a service would, of course, be much higher. </p>
               <p>For the infrastructure itself, we estimate an annual cost of the order of 150K, to
                  cover at least three full time appointments, and funding for meetings, workshops,
                  publications, etc. Again, it is assumed that the central <name rend="abbr"
                     >ahds</name> office will be located at some existing institution which will
                  underwrite establishment and similar costs. </p>

                  <head>Workshop </head>
                  <p>The Feasibility Study began with a Workshop at which several of the ideas now
                     proposed were first discussed. The Workshop was held at the British Academy on
                     29-30 March 1994. More than fifty invitations were issued, and the Workshop was
                     attended by a total of 28 experts, drawn from a wide range of academic
                     backgrounds and with particular interest and expertise in most of the relevant
                     academic, professional and technical areas. Following the Workshop, a summary
                     report was published which identified the key issues raised and points of view expressed.<note>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Workshop participants took the unanimous view that what was needed was some
                     kind of infrastructure which could effectively manage the provision of a range
                     of distributed services, rather than a single centre to hold and archive data.
                     This notion, presented tentatively at the Workshop, has become a key issue in
                     the present proposals. The Workshop also strongly recommended that the term
                        <q>data service</q> should replace <q>data centre</q> in the original
                     project title. </p>

                  <head>Consultation </head>
                  <p>The intention of the project team and steering group was to consult as widely
                     as possible within the relevant communities. To this end the Workshop Report
                     was disseminated widely by both paper and electronic means. Groups,
                     institutions and individuals known to have an interest were identified as
                     specific targets, but the distribution was deliberately wider than this, and
                     comments were invited from any interested party. Full details of the process
                     are given in Appendix <ref target="apco">7.2 Consultation Exercise </ref>. </p>
                  <p>Despite the very short time available for public discussion and comment,
                     distribution of these documents generated a large and almost entirely
                     enthusiastic response from the community. Many useful comments and ideas were
                     provided, which have been incorporated in the present report wherever possible.
                     Appendix <ref target="apcore">7.2.2 Responses </ref> lists the institutions and
                     individuals who responded during this consultation process. Full details of

                  <head>Fact Finding </head>
                  <p>It was hoped to investigate in some detail the provision of relevant data sets
                     from a number of existing institutions in the UK, Europe and North America. To
                     this end, a set of questions (reproduced in Appendix <ref target="apq">7.3.5
                        Consultation Document</ref>) was devised for use as a basis for gathering
                     information by interview or other means. </p>
                  <p>Although time did not permit all the relevant institutions to be pursued, those
                     approached were unfailingly constructive and helpful and provided much useful
                     information. Where possible this information gathering was carried out by means
                     of visits and interviews, and otherwise by electronic mail. There were also a
                     number of conferences which covered issues relevant to the study. The
                     institutions consulted and events attended are listed in Appendix <ref
                        target="apco">7.2 Consultation Exercise </ref>. </p>
                  <p>In a number of cases, detailed visit reports were produced by project staff or
                     colleagues; these are not included in this report, but are for the most part
                     available electronically from the authors. </p>

                     Computing Services and Harold Short of King's College London Computing Centre.
                     The project received support and guidance from a Steering Group appointed by
                     the ISSC. Members of this group were: <list>
                        <item>Chair: Dr Richard Heseltine, Librarian of the University of Hull, and
                           member of the ISSC;</item>

                     assisted during the drafting of the report. Assistance in drafting and
                     researching several sections of the report was provided by the <name>Marc
                        Fresko Consultancy</name>. The authors of the report also gratefully
                     acknowledge the assistance provided by colleagues and management at their own

                     hospitality and help provided by the institutions and individuals visited
                     during the course of the study. The bulk of the report is, however, the work of
                     the authors, who are responsible for any errors or inconsistencies found in it.

                  <head>Data sets and services today </head>
                  <p>In some disciplines, and in some countries, deposit of digital data sets in
                        <q>approved</q> archives is a common and accepted condition of grant. This
                     is frequently not the case in humanities disciplines in the United Kingdom, as
                     a brief informal survey of four funding institutions has shown. </p>
                  <p>Each year the <name>British Academy</name> funds a significant number of
                     projects which result in the creation of arts or humanities data sets. Since
                     1992 it has required applicants for grants to provide evidence that they have
                     made adequate provision for the long-term access and preservation of the
                     resources generated by the project. </p>
                  <p>The <name>British Library Research and Development Department</name> funds
                     several projects every year, some of which result in the creation of relevant
                     data sets, though these often are small and with limited scope for re-use (some
                     are specifically precluded from widespread use due to copyright restrictions).
                     It typically has <q>encouraged</q> creators of data sets to deposit them at the
                        <name>ESRC Data Archive</name> (see <ref target="ipeda">8.1.3.4 Source of
                        funding:</ref>), without making this a condition of grant; not all data sets
                     so created have been deposited. The Library is considering a policy which
                     requires deposit as a condition of grant. </p>
                  <p>The <name>Getty Art History Information Program</name> has funded two projects
                     in the UK explicitly concerned with the creation of data sets.<note>These are
                        the <title>Witt Computer Index</title>, at the <name>Witt Library</name>,
                           <name>Courtauld Institute of Art</name>, and the <title>Census of Antique
                           Art and Architecture Known to the Renaissance</title> developed jointly
                        by the <name>Warburg Institute</name> in London and the <name>Biblioteca
                           Herziana</name> in Rome.</note> In both cases, the projects were required
                     to deposit copies with the Institute (in California), but not elsewhere. </p>
                  <p>The <name>Leverhulme Trust</name> funds about 50 humanities projects each year,
                     many of which include data set creation. It does not impose conditions
                     concerning access, deposit or preservation. </p>
                  <p>The <name>Economic and Social Sciences Research Council</name> (<name
                        rend="abbr">esrc</name>) funds a variety of projects relevant to the
                     humanities, particularly in history and linguistics; deposit of resultant data
                     sets is a condition of grant. However, where researchers in the humanities have
                     been successful in obtaining funding for major projects from more
                     scientifically-oriented research councils, these have not always included any
                     provision for the long-term availability of any resources created. For example,
                     several language engineering projects were funded by the <name>Science and
                        Engineering Research Council</name> (<name rend="abbr">serc</name>), under
                     the Speech and Language Technology initiative, but their availability to the
                     humanities community at large remains unclear. Often individual resource
                     creation projects have been expected to manage distribution for themselves,
                     with consequent dangers of invisibility outside the immediate research
                     communities served. </p>
                  <p>There is an expectation that data set provision can be made economically viable
                     and self-sustaining in the long term. This may be true for some kinds of
                     resource where the demand is clear and sustained; it is less self-evident in
                     the general case, particularly for the wide range of materials likely to be of
                     interest to the Humanities. </p>
                  <p>The provision of services is varied and and uneven. There are two formally
                     constituted data archives the <name>History Data Unit</name> of the <name>
                        <name rend="abbr">esrc</name> Data Archive</name> at the <name>University of
                        Essex</name>,<note>The History Data Unit was established by a grant from
                           <name rend="abbr">esrc</name> ending in December 1994.</note> and the
                        <name>Oxford Text Archive</name> at <name>Oxford University</name>.
                     Otherwise the management of data sets, including access, documentation, support
                     and preservation, depends very much on the awareness and resources of the
                     individual projects and their host institution. </p>

                     This suggested that there is a demand for commercial data sets, many of which
                     are too expensive for smaller institutions to obtain individually.<note>The
                        results of this survey have not yet been published.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>While it is in any single publisher's interest to maintain archival copies of
                     its materials, there is no commercial imperative to do so. On the contrary, it
                     is easily possible to imagine commercial pressures which would result in data
                     sets for which there is little demand being discarded. We are not aware of any
                     unified source or catalogue for these materials; nor are we aware of any
                     widely-used standard for works published in electronic form. </p>

                  <head>The international dimension</head>
                  <p>Although, for practical reasons, the focus in our discussion is largely within
                     the UK, there are many relevant institutions and projects outside the UK. There
                     has always been a strong international tradition among scholars, which has been
                     greatly facilitated by the ease with which students and researchers can now
                     cross international frontiers electronically in their pursuit of digital
                     resources. Indeed, there is a clearly emerging tendency for a small number of
                     academic experts working within a comparatively narrow specialization but
                     spread across several countries, to gain <q>critical mass</q> by working
                     together using the Internet, thereby achieving results greater than the sum of
                     the results they might achieve individually. </p>
                  <p>Alongside this the rapid and chaotic growth of the Internet has to be taken
                     into account, comprising as it does a certain number of stable well-ordered
                     data sets and services and very large volume of unregulated activity and
                     information. This presents problems of its own; for it has become difficult to
                     distinguish useful high-quality information from the low-grade material
                     available side by side. (<q>On the one hand everything is available. But on the
                        other hand, <hi>everything</hi> is available.</q> - Alfred Glossbrenner).
                     The difficulty of locating appropriate resources has become a common complaint.

                        data sets.<note>One example, of many, is <term>Structured Systems Analysis
                              and Design Methodology</term> (<name rend="abbr">ssadm</name>). This
                           widely used methodology was originally developed by Learmont and
                           Burchett, and was subsequently adopted as a standard within the Civil

                     <p>Platform-independent standards for data encoding are essential to ensure
                        transferability and re-usability of data. Such re-usability has academic
                        benefits in terms of increasing the resources available for research and
                        teaching, of allowing arguments and conclusions to be challenged by
                        manipulation of a particular data set, and also, where copyright conditions
                        of use permit it, of enabling resources to be <q>re-purposed</q> i.e.
                        modified or adapted to serve a new teaching or research purpose.
                        Re-usability also has economic importance: high-quality electronic resources
                        are expensive to produce, and it is important to ensure that as far as
                        possible their re-use is a matter of academic judgment rather than of
                        technical or financial constraint.</p>

                     <p>Currently platform-independence remains a goal rather than a reality for the
                        most part. However, data encoding is an area of great activity and promise
                        for all data types, with the work of the <name>Text Encoding
                           Initiative</name> (<name rend="abbr">tei</name>) offering particular
                        promise (see Section <ref target="sd">4 Standardization </ref>). On the
                        other hand, for certain types of resources, such as databases and <name
                           rend="abbr">cbl</name> packages, platform- independence is somewhat

                        resource is to be accessed and manipulated on-line. If so, consideration has
                        to be given to which access tools users will be able to employ. Among the
                        most common network access mechanisms are <term>Gopher</term>, <term>World
                           Wide Web</term> (<name rend="abbr">www</name>), and <term>Wide Area
                           Information Server</term> (<name rend="abbr">wais</name>). Use of any of
                        these systems involves additional encoding issues which should be considered
                        when the resource is created.</p>

                     <p>There is considerable activity in this area among the Archive community.
                        Until recently, the major preservation medium was magnetic tape, with new
                        copies made periodically to protect against physical deterioration. Optical
                        disc technologies are now increasingly widely used, but there are no
                        universally accepted standards. The <name>Council of European Social
                           Sciences Data Archives</name> (<name rend="abbr">cessda</name>) has
                        initiated a project on preservation methodology, based at the <name>ESRC
                           Data Archive</name>.<note>Where the scale of copying required from an old
                           medium to a new one makes the task too costly, it may be necessary for
                           old hardware and/or software to be retained. The ESRC Archive, for
                           example, retains a punched card reader in order to maintain the
                           availability of certain of its older data sets.</note>

                        involved, at least in parallel publishing on paper and CD-ROM; a number are

                           <name rend="abbr">nep</name> is currently based at the <name>UK Office

                           >cni</name>) is based on a similar concept. </p>
                     <p>Another approach has been to develop interfaces between gateways of

                     <p>A great many of the resources currently available on the Internet cannot be
                        relied upon. Many exist only on an individual's personal computer, and are
                        therefore unavailable if that machine is switched off or if it has a
                        hardware, software or communications fault. Among the established data
                        archives, the situation is a great deal better, of course. In many cases the
                        file servers are mirrored, so that a fault with one does not bring the
                        service down. It is also common to design communications systems with a
                        degree of redundancy. Another benefit of redundancy can be performance. The
                           <name>DANTE InfoFlow</name> project is based on a design of interlinked
                        (national) data servers, with data replicated on two or more of these, to
                        avoid access bottlenecks as well as to ensure a stable and reliable service

            </head>
            <p>This section discusses the scope of an Arts and Humanities Data Service, in terms of
               the disciplines and data types to be supported, and the community of users served.
               This is followed by a description of the proposed constitution and organization of
               the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>, and a detailed discussion of its functions. </p>
            <div xml:id="stsc">
               <head>Disciplines and data types</head>
               <p>The subject areas constituting the Humanities are potentially very large and
                  diverse. They include the study of all languages, both individually and as
                  linguistic systems, from all periods (modern, medieval and classical); they also
                  include the study of an equally wide spread of literatures, as well as many other
                  art forms, visual and plastic, performing and creative. The Historical disciplines
                  are at least as wide-ranging in their scope as the literary or linguistic ones,
                  including all forms of historical text, data set, artefact and social structure.
                  Any workable definition of the Humanities must also include such topics as
                  theology, philosophy, religious studies, archaeology, art history, anthropology,
                  social and political studies. Eventually, even purely scientific data sets become
                  of interest to the historian of science. </p>
               <p>There are many areas of overlap both within the Humanities, and between the
                  Humanities and other disciplines, particularly but not exclusively the Social
                  Sciences. The disciplines most involved would include History, Political Studies,
                  Linguistics, Anthropology, Archaeology, and Geography. In terms of the kind of
                  services under discussion therefore, the question of service overlap (and
                  collaboration) must be addressed, especially with respect to services already
                  funded by the various scientific research councils. For example, <name>ESRC</name>
                  funds the <name>ESRC Data Archive</name> at Essex, <name>MIDAS</name> at
                  Manchester, and <name>NOMIS</name> at Durham. Similar services in other
                  disciplines are funded by the <name>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
                     Council</name> (<name rend="abbr">eprc</name>), the <name>National
                     Environmental Research Council</name> (<name rend="abbr">nerc</name>), the
                     <name>Royal Commission for Historical Monuments</name> (<name rend="abbr"
                     >rchme</name>), English Heritage etc. </p>
               <p>As well as a richness and variety of disciplines, resources of interest to the
                  Humanities are characterized by richness and variety of data types. At least the
                  following may be identified: <list>
                     <item> texts in all languages and orthographies, of all times;</item>
                     <item> still images (bi-level bitmap, colour bitmap, three-
                        dimensional);</item>
                     <item> sounds (both naturally occurring recorded sound and synthesized digital
                        information intended to be played as sound);</item>
                     <item> moving images (with or without sound, two or three- dimensional, colour
                        or monochrome);</item>
                     <item> numerical data, both scalar (e.g. survey results) and vector (e.g.
                        pictorial);</item>
                     <item> symbolic data, for example describing musical scores;</item>
                     <item>multimedia, which could include all of the above.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Some disciplines are primarily text-based, and others artefact- image-, or
                  sound-based; all, however, typically combine resources of all kinds. The need to
                  share expertise in the management of different data types across disciplines is
                  correspondingly important. </p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="stsccmn">
               <head>The <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> Community </head>
               <p>The primary community served by the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> may be defined
                  as comprising all institutions and individuals engaged in research or teaching in
                  higher education in the UK, within any of the humanities disciplines as described
                  above, and producing or using electronic materials of any type (as described
                  above). </p>
               <p>Although the emphasis must be on creating an infrastructure to serve the needs of
                  this community, this can be done effectively only by collaborating actively with
                  projects and institutions in wider Europe, North America and beyond. At a
                  practical level this will have implications for the Catalogue and Gateway services
                  of <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>, and for the initial Service Providers. The
                  opportunity to pursue formal organizational relationships and joint projects is of
                  considerable importance. </p>
               <p>In the same way, it is important to ensure that the community served by the <name
                     rend="abbr">ahds</name> can readily be extended to the wider UK community.
                  Contacts with Local History associations, for example, have been found a
                  productive source of expertise for the <name>History Data Unit</name> at the Essex
                     Archive.<note>In Denmark, the <name>Danish Data Archive</name> is co-ordinating
                     a massive <title>Data Entry Project</title> in which a small army of volunteers
                     is being organized to encode in electronic form all extant Danish census,
                     parish, land and military registers, for research use.</note> As free access to
                  networked resources becomes less and less a prerogative of the academic world, the
                     <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> must be ready to provide its services to a wider
                  public. The funding implications of this potentially enormous explosion in demand
                  have yet to be thought through but it is clear that the <name rend="abbr"
                     >ahds</name> will have a central role to play in establishing policy and
                  procedures by which Arts and Humanities data services may be provided to other
                  education sectors (in particular secondary education) and to the general public,
                  for example in public libraries.<note>As an example of what is possible we may
                     cite the outreach work of the <name>Norwegian Social Sciences Data
                        Archive</name> (<name rend="abbr">nsd</name>). This Archive co-ordinates
                     mock elections in Norwegian secondary schools before national elections and
                     referendums, analyzing and publishing the results nationally. Their

               <p>The proposed Arts and Humanities Data Service comprises a centralized
                  infrastructure, which acts as a framework within which a number of <term>Service

               <p>The infrastructure will consist of a <term>Management Committee</term>, an
                     <term>Executive</term> and a <term>Service Providers Forum</term>. The <name
                     rend="abbr">ahds</name> Management Committee will have the overall
                  responsibility for the service. The <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> Executive will
                  be responsible for implementing the decisions of the Management Committee and,
                  together with the Service Providers Forum, for formulating policy proposals for
                  its consideration. </p>
               <p>It is envisaged that initially the infrastructure will support a small number of

                  managing a number of <term>data sets</term>. The flexibility of the proposed

                  Providers and/or more specialized <q>Affiliated</q> Service Providers. The latter
                  will typically provide services in relation to a single activity or data set, e.g.
                  a <term>specialist collection</term>. It is anticipated that central funding will
                  be made available to establish the service initially, but the proposed structure
                  does not depend on any particular funding model. </p>
               <p>The <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> infrastructure has both strategic and

                     aspects of the Executive's work. The exact composition and structure of the
                     Executive should be the subject of bidding, but a number of important functions
                     are identified below.</p>
                  <p>For practical reasons, the Executive should be established within some suitable

                     will need to be specified, but the host would be expected to provide
                     considerable institutional support. </p>

                  <p>There are likely to be some non-affiliated institutions wishing to make

               <p n="relations">The strategic functions of the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> will be
                  carried out by the Executive, at the direction of the Management Committee.
                  However, it will be important for the Executive to consult closely with the
                  Service Providers Forum, and for the latter to play a significant role in the
                  development of policy. </p>
               <p n="strategy">One of the primary functions will be to formulate long-term strategic
                  policy with respect to the following fundamental requirements: <list>
                     <item> initiation and reception of proposals for service provision; </item>
                     <item> maintenance of appropriate consultation and debate with the <name

                     <item> methods of making funding or other recommendations to external funding

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="standards">An essential component of the strategic role will be the development
                  of a framework within which standardized codes of practice may be developed and
                  articulated. Such codes of practice are needed in all the following areas: <list>
                     <item> data creation, preparation and encoding; </item>
                     <item> data documentation and description;</item>
                     <item>creation of catalogue entries; </item>
                     <item> data preservation;<note>These will include not only standards on the
                           number of security copies, frequency of update, and the location and
                           security of the <q>vaults</q> in which they are held, but also the
                           technical aspects relating to media type.</note>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>At this strategic level the concern will be with the developments of
                     <term>guidelines</term> within which specific standards will be adopted or
                  implemented at the operational level, as further discussed in section <ref
                     target="sd">4 Standardization </ref>. These guidelines should incorporate a
                  considerable degree of flexibility to allow for different types of data or
                  service, and differing local institutional structures. A <q>layered</q> approach
                  to the issue of conformance will be taken, for at least the short term, in which
                  suppliers can elect to conform at a specific level. Again, the definition of the
                  exact nature of conformance at a specific level is an operational matter; the
                  principle of layered conformance, and the extent to which it will be supported, is
                  a strategic one. </p>
               <p n="funding"> In line with <name rend="abbr">jisc</name> policy for all the
                  services which it funds, the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> will be required to
                  establish evaluation criteria and procedural mechanisms to set in place both
                  initial and continuation funding of Service Providers. It will also need to
                  establish credible performance evaluation and review procedures and indicators. </p>
               <p n="credit">
                  <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> policy will be to attempt to establish a framework
                  within which appropriate academic credit can be given for the creation of data
                  sets, both for teaching and research, which conform to <name rend="abbr"
                     >ahds</name>-specified standards, and which will place appropriate emphasis on
                  their documentation, accessibility, and re-usability. Peer review procedures,
                  perhaps external to the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>, will be required to assure
                  the academic quality of the data sets. Creating this framework will involve both a
                  close monitoring of the usage of <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> data services,
                  (inter alia, to ensure proper citation) and promoting greater awareness of the use
                  and potential of electronic resources within the Higher Education community, in
                  co-operation with the <name>British Academy</name> and its <name>Humanities
                     Research Board</name>, as well as the <name>Computers in Teaching

               <p>In the development of its strategic policy the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> will
                  need to work closely with relevant national initiatives and institutions. For
                  example all of the programme areas of the <name>Follett Implementation Group on
                     Information Technology</name> (<name rend="abbr">figit</name>) will be relevant
                  to the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>. Liaison with the <name rend="abbr"
                     >jisc</name>'s <name>Datasets Steering Group</name> will be needed in the
                  development of data acquisition strategies. The <name>British Library</name> has a

                  information resources and services in the UK. </p>
               <p>European and international dimensions will also be important in strategy
                  development. In Europe, one particularly relevant project is
                     <title>InfoServices</title>, a joint initiative in the Netherlands between the
                  National Research Network Service and the National Library to develop a national
                  information service. This project will be addressing many of the same strategic
                  issues, in relation to documentation, standards and resource discovery which are
                  being addressed by <name rend="abbr">figit</name>, and within that framework, by
                  the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>. </p>

               <p>Certain services are strategically important to the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>
                  as a whole, and should be centrally managed. Chief among these are the

                  <p>A major <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> priority should be the creation of a
                     comprehensive on-line catalogue of electronic resources in the Arts and
                     Humanities an <term>Arts and Humanities Electronic Resource Catalogue</term>,
                     with extensive and consistent indexes. Careful research is needed to identify
                     the most appropriate mechanisms for gathering the information a non-trivial
                     task, and for maintaining it and making it available a little less problematic
                     perhaps once the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> is established. Some of the
                     information required for this has been acquired, e.g. in recent surveys carried
                     out by the <name>British Academy</name> and the <name>Office for Humanities
                        Communication</name>. However, a great deal of systematic development work
                     will be required. </p>
                  <p>It is likely that the central catalogue would replicate the catalogues at
                     Service Provider or local institutional level, or would be regularly updated
                     from these sources. However, it would be important to have a single agency
                     within the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> charged with the responsibility of
                     maintaining this co-ordinated service. </p>
                  <p>The Catalogue service provider would naturally have the role of liaison with
                     the library and networking bodies involved in developing standards for resource
                     identification and resource description, and of co-ordinating the <name

                  <p>The functions of the Gateway would be to provide a convenient point of access
                     to registered <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> resources, and also to
                     international and non-humanities resources. In relation to the first of these
                     functions, it would make a lot of sense for the Gateway to be linked to the
                     Catalogue, and there would be strong arguments for the development of the two
                     as a single integrated service. </p>
                  <p>Going outwards, the primary links from the Gateway would be to other gateway
                     services. In this context the Gateway service provider would have the role of
                     liaison with other gateway providers in the UK, Europe, and elsewhere, and of
                     monitoring developments in this rapidly developing field. </p>
                  <p>The Gateway service provider should also be very involved in the national and
                     international work to develop resource discovery tools and common user
                     interfaces, and should co-ordinate <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> activity in
                     this area. </p>
                  <p>An <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> Gateway could also, if so desired, be used as
                     a means to control access to <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> resources, and could

                  <p>Consideration should be given to the question of whether it would be more

                  <p>It may be that the expertise required in the area of long-term archiving of
                     data has more to do with technical and preservation issues than with data type
                     or discipline, and that there would be significant economies of scale in
                     establishing a single archival operation for the purposes of the long-term
                     preservation of data sets. The project which the <name>ESRC Data Archive</name>

               <p>In this section, we discuss in more detail the functions common to <name
                     rend="abbr">ahds</name> Service Providers. As noted above, not all service
                  providers will necessarily perform all of these <term>data services</term>
                  directly. They will however be expected to demonstrate an ability to support the
                  majority of these functions, either directly or by subcontract, as a pre-requisite
                  when bidding for a service provision contract. (See further section <ref
                     target="stisco">3.9 Service Provision Contracts </ref>.) </p>
               <div xml:id="stsea">
                  <head>Accession of data sets </head>
                  <p>Under this heading we group such functions as the creation of new data sets and
                     the acquisition of existing but unsupported data sets. In each case this may
                     involve negotiation with IPR holders and other contractual arrangements with
                     data depositors, which should be carried out according to norms defined by
                     current <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> policies. Where unsupported data sets,
                     possibly of unknown provenance, are acquired, care should be taken that rights
                     are not unwittingly infringed. </p>
                  <p>Where new data sets are being created, the principles on which they are
                     selected and processed should be specified, and some indication given of the
                     methods of quality assurance to be applied. In particular, individual Service
                     Providers will seek to liaise closely with resource creators to ensure that
                     relevant <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> standards are applied <hi>ab
                     initio</hi>. It may also be desirable to provide some degree of <name
                        rend="abbr">ahds</name> funding for such purposes, and for the <name
                        rend="abbr">ahds</name> to act pro-actively in facilitating the creation of
                     specific resources where a clear demand has been identified. </p>
                  <p>Once acquired, data sets must be catalogued locally, and then incorporated
                     within the central catalogue. Again, this should be carried out according to
                        <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>-defined norms. Cataloguing is a highly
                     specialized (and expensive) task, and it would therefore be reasonable for
                     individual service providers to seek the advice and support of subject
                     specialists, provided that these are aware of <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>
                     standards. Some aspects of cataloguing require detailed subject expertise which
                     may be more readily available locally. A staged approach may also be
                     appropriate, in which a minimal level of cataloguing detail is provided for use
                     by the central cataloguers, with more detailed information being added later
                     from the local store. </p>

                  <p>Under this heading we class a number of functions applicable to electronic
                     resources in general, but of particular importance to shared data sets: <list>

                     </list>These functions apply equally to data resources and their documentation.
                     Service providers will need to specify the level at which the resources
                     provided will conform to <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> standards and policies
                     with respect to archival storage (for example, how many copies will be kept,
                     the mode of storage, etc.) as well as to the correction of notified errors, the
                     degree of encoding applied, the checking applied to ensure conformance to
                     specific standards, and so forth. </p>
                  <p>As with cataloguing, long-term storage may be regarded as a specialized task
                     contracted out to specialist agencies. All service providers must however take
                     full responsibility for ensuring that the relevant standards are implemented to

                  <p>Monitoring and control of access is also essential, for contractual and
                     performance reasons alike. Service providers will be required to produce
                     regular statistics on the use made of their facilities which will feed into the

                  <p>Under this heading, Service Providers will be expected to specify the degree of
                     user training and support provided. This is likely to range widely for
                     different kinds of data and different user communities. Telephone or email
                     queries should be promptly and helpfully answered within defined norms.
                     Introductory guides and tutorials, and specialist workshops or conferences as
                     appropriate, should be organized. In each case, minimal service level
                     agreements must be observed, and quality assurance measures enforced.
                     Evaluation of take-up of the services offered is also a necessary part of
                     service provision. </p>
                  <p>Because of the variation in user communities, and the corresponding importance
                     of subject-specific knowledge, it is probable that these facilities will be
                     best organized in close collaboration with specialist subject centres such as
                     those offered by existing <name rend="abbr">cti</name> and <name rend="abbr"
                        >tltp</name> projects. Affiliation with such centres is not, however, a

               <head>Service Provision Contracts </head>
               <p>Service provision should be defined by contracts between the <name rend="abbr"
                     >ahds</name> Executive acting on behalf of its Management Committee, and
                  individual Service Providers. We anticipate only a small number (three or four) of
                  such contracts in the short to medium term, but propose that a mechanism should be
                  defined now to enable a graceful scaling-up of the operation. </p>
               <p>In the long term, we suggest that there should be calls for proposals for service
                  provision in specified subject areas, to enable the service to respond easily to
                  changes within the field. These calls should invite bids which will be assessed by
                  peer review, paying particular attention to the following criteria: <list>
                     <item>existing or demonstrable demand for the resource being offered;</item>
                     <item>existing expertise and experience or the capacity to develop and manage

               <p>Bids may request funding for additional equipment or support staff required to
                  provide access to the service from outside the host institution; in principle the
                  host institution will be expected to bear all costs of providing internal access.
                  Funding may also be requested for additional work needed to bring an existing
                  service into line with specified <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> standards. </p>
               <p>Because it is assumed that infrastructure costs will be largely borne by the host
                  institution, bids should also demonstrate that an appropriate level of computing,
                  library, and other relevant support will be available from their host
                  institutions. </p>
               <p>We propose that contracts should be awarded for a minimum period of not less than

                  <label>data preservation</label>
                  <item>concerns all aspects of the specific services and functions needed to ensure

            <p>In each case, a balance must be found between the need to ensure that resources
               remain usable over long periods of time and in many different contexts, and the need
               to adapt rapidly to changing technology (and fashions) in a rapidly developing field.
               Fortunately, this is a problem by no means unique to arts and humanities data users
               or providers. </p>

               <head>Standards Reference Guide</head>
               <p>The <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> will need to identify and specify the standards
                  considered relevant in each of the above mentioned areas. We propose that an early
                  work item should be the production of a technical report, which will form the
                  basis of a <term>Standards Reference Guide</term> (<name rend="abbr">srg</name>)
                  defining levels of standardization mandatory on all <name rend="abbr"
                  >ahds</name>-affiliated data services and data sets. Important input to this
                  process will be the <name rend="abbr">figit</name> Framework Program for Standards
                  activities. The <name rend="abbr">srg</name> will of necessity be an extensible

                     <item>standards based on existing practice are to be preferred, where this does

                     <item>defined levels of conformance to particular standards are useful;</item>
                     <item>different standards may obtain for data formats in different subject
                        specialisations;</item>
                     <item>uniform standards for data provision and data description should be

               </p>
               <p>The existence of the <name rend="abbr">srg</name> will help individual resource
                  providers position their services with respect to overall <name rend="abbr"
                     >ahds</name> policies, and hence to define meaningful service level agreements.
                  It will also provide agencies concerned with the funding of such services with a
                  set of appropriate performance metrics. Its definition is one of the most
                  important of the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> strategic functions. Its continued
                  maintenance will also be an essential task, requiring non-trivial effort for the

               <head>Data Formats </head>
               <p>Standardization is currently well advanced in this domain, with many competing or
                  overlapping standards in a number of areas. Fortunately, considerable expertise
                  exists within the academic and industrial data processing communities with respect
                  to data conversion and inter-operability of systems. Service providers and other
                  appropriate groups of experts will be asked to provide short lists of
                  recommendations, perhaps with differing emphases in different subject areas, as to
                  the commonly observed standards for data format. </p>
               <div xml:id="sdiseg1">
                  <head>Textual data</head>
                  <p>For the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> purposes, the most appropriate standard
                     is likely to be that provided by the <name>Text Encoding Initiative</name>'s
                        <q>Guidelines</q> (TEI P3, 1994). This provides an internationally-accepted
                     set of recommendations for the standardized encoding of a very wide range of
                     textual and other data formats, based on <name rend="abbr">sgml</name> which is
                     itself a widely implemented <name rend="abbr">iso</name> standard (ISO 8879),
                     of increasing importance in both commercial and academic publishing worlds. We
                     know of no other equally relevant standard for the widest variety of arts and
                     humanities data. The <name rend="abbr">tei</name> Recommendations have the
                     unusual virtue of combining in one integrated framework a set of
                     recommendations for data representation, data interpretation or analysis and
                     data documentation, which is designed to be independent of any particular
                     application area, software environment or hardware platform. </p>
                  <p>Although under development since 1989, the <name rend="abbr">tei</name>
                     <q>Guidelines</q> were published only in May 1994. Expertise and software
                     capable of exploiting them is rapidly becoming available, in part because of an
                     increased awareness of <name rend="abbr">sgml</name> itself within the academic
                     community, but is by no means widespread. It is therefore important to ensure
                     that large existing collections of data do not remain inaccessible to the <name
                        rend="abbr">ahds</name> community until they can be converted to use it. </p>
                  <p>We anticipate that there will be a considerable start-up cost associated with
                     conversion of <q>legacy data</q>, but that this cost will rapidly decrease.

                  and information science community and outside it. It is only a slight exaggeration
                  to say that at present the quality of information available in <q>gopher space</q>
                  is indirectly proportional to its quantity: never before have so many known so
                  little about so much. </p>
               <p>The most promising basis for an improvement in this situation will be a careful
                  examination of existing standards for bibliographic description, and their
                  relevance to the description of non-book materials. Relevant standards include
                     <name rend="abbr">aacr2</name> (1988), and <name rend="abbr">iso</name> 690
                  (1987). Monitoring of the development of more electronically-relevant standards
                  such as <name rend="abbr">marc</name> will be of great importance, and is likely
                  to have considerable impact within the library community. The recommendations of
                  the <name rend="abbr">tei</name> for formal documentation of electronic texts are
                  also of great relevance here, since these are explicitly modelled on the <name
                     rend="abbr">isbd</name>. </p>
               <p>The identification and approval of any pre-existing descriptive thesauri
                  appropriate within given subject areas will be of considerable assistance to
                  subject-specific resource providers. The high cost of building and maintaining
                  indexes based on such thesauri should be set against the enormous increase in data
                  accessibility which they typically facilitate. </p>
               <p>This is particularly true for the description of visual images in verbal or
                  encoded form, without which large scale image databases are likely to be entirely
                  unmanageable. Natural language descriptive thesauri (similar to those used for
                  other data sets) are widely used, for example by the <name>Getty
                  Foundation</name>'s projects. For representational art in the Western European
                  tradition there also exist abstract descriptive schemes such as
                     <term>Iconclass</term>. </p>
               <p>Wide consultation involving creators, users and subject specialists will be
                  necessary to ensure that data documentation supports both informed and responsible
                  data usage. The <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> will need to formulate clear
                  guidelines as to the level and scope of data documentation which is essential,
                  desirable, or useful, for each of a variety of resources. It should also provide
                  helpful guidelines for those seeking to create documentation tools, such as
                  database proformas, or could initiate and manage projects to develop such tools.

               <p>There are few pre-existing formal standards of relevance in this area. We expect
                  therefore that the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> will begin by tabulating and
                  codifying existing codes of practice with a view to agreeing levels of conformity
                  amongst all <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> service providers. We propose that an
                  effective way of carrying this out might be to set up small task groups to report
                  on specific areas in which individual practice tends to diverge. These task groups
                  should be composed of a small number (five or less) of experts, not necessarily
                  involved with the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>, who might be required to report
                  back with detailed proposals for standardization within a reasonable time scale
                  (say nine months). </p>
               <p>Most of the areas of concern common to all <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> service
                  providers were discussed above in section <ref target="cu">2 Perceived needs and

                  <head>Charging and licensing</head>
                  <p>It has to be recognized that there are always costs associated with the
                     creation and maintenance of electronic resources. It is not unreasonable to
                     seek to relate the value of such resources for subsequent users directly to
                     these costs. However, some ambivalence exists within the academic community on
                     this point. There is a widely-held view amongst information consumers that all
                     services should be free, just as there is an equally widely-held expectation
                     (often located in the same individuals) that information provision should be
                     remunerated in some way. A variety of mechanisms have been developed to resolve
                     this contradiction, of which the three most popular appear to be:
                        <term>top-slicing</term> -- where access to a resource is centrally-funded
                     once for all, but appears to be free to the individual; <term>differential
                        charging</term> -- where free access to a resource by one group (academics)
                     is effectively subsidized by the high charges made for access to the same
                     resource by another group (commercial users); and <term>subscription</term> --
                     where payment of a single fee provides unlimited access to members only. In the
                     network environment other modes of charging have also been proposed, such as
                     the notion of <q>pay by use</q> -- where an automatic charge is levied for each
                     access to a given network resource or group of resources. </p>
                  <p>It would be premature for the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> to
                        <emph>begin</emph> by proposing any <emph>particular</emph> charging policy.
                     However, it is an area of policy-making which should be tackled as a matter of
                     urgency. Longer term, the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> will need to remain
                     capable of responding flexibly to changes in public attitude, or even
                     legislation, which are the ultimate determiners of such matters. All of that
                     said, it is clearly in the interests of the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>
                     community that as few barriers as possible be introduced between users and
                     providers of data resources. </p>
                  <p>Service providers may in any case need to adopt different cost-recovery
                     procedures. Some may need to recover only media costs; others may need to
                     recover a proportion of the cost of creating and maintaining the resources
                     within a defined period. In some cases, costs may be beyond the control of
                     service providers, being determined by external agencies who make resources
                     available to service providers on certain terms only. </p>
                  <p>In the case of commercially-funded resource provision, the existing expertise
                     of bodies such as <name rend="abbr">chest</name> should be employed to
                     negotiate satisfactory contracts for the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>
                     community as a whole, rather than solely for the benefit of the richer members
                     of that community. </p>
                  <p>Where resources are prepared specifically for the <name rend="abbr"
                     >ahds</name>, clear policies regarding their possible commercial exploitation
                     need to be set in place. There is growing evidence, for example in the <name
                        rend="abbr">tltp</name> programme, of the commercial viability of certain
                     kinds of Arts and Humanities Data Resources: the expertise of bodies such as
                     the <name>Association for Learning Technology</name> (<name rend="abbr"
                        >alt</name>), of commercial publishers, and of academic industrial liaison
                     officers should be sought to ensure that appropriate royalties are derived from
                     such resources. </p>
                  <p>Where charges are made, for whatever reason, it is likely that differential
                     rates may be applied to different users. One common model is to provide
                     commercial access at a premium rate, royalties from which can then be used to
                     subsidize academic access. It is not always easy to distinguish <q>academic</q>
                     and <q>commercial</q> institutions or usage however. Equally, if institutions
                     not funded by the Funding Councils wish to access the service, it is likely
                     that differential charging rates would be applicable. </p>
                  <p>Cost recovery for the service as a whole is greatly complicated by the fact
                     that very large economies of scale may be obtained by localization of some key
                     strategic functions such as data preservation and data description. </p>
                  <p>We recommend that, as a first step, existing charging policies of all <name
                        rend="abbr">ahds</name> service providers be collated, and if possible made
                     consistent. Where no financial charge is made, but certain conditions are
                     imposed (for example, as with the <name rend="abbr">gnu</name> public licence),
                     the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> should attempt to define a legally acceptable
                     formulation of the conditions. Where charging at some level is essential to the
                     provision of a resource, guidelines for an acceptable level of charging, and
                     mechanisms for its recovery from the community or elsewhere need to be defined.
                     At this stage, it is probably only possible to identify commonly occurring
                     practices and highlight the strengths or weaknesses of each. The proposed
                     structure allows for cost-recovery and administration at data set, service
                     provider or <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> level. </p>

                  <p>
                     <name rend="abbr">ipr</name> considerations have always been closely related to
                     charging issues: ownership of an intellectual property right is one way of
                     justifying making a charge for it. However, the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>
                     has a wider role to play in defining acceptable agreements with <name
                        rend="abbr">ipr</name> holders than simply setting a fair price. It is
                     widely recognized that this is a highly complex issue: current legislation in
                     this area is both confused and confusing, with entirely different principles
                     applying to information in different formats, or distributed to different
                     countries. As with pricing, it is something which will need to be addressed as
                     a matter of urgency by <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>, working in close
                     collaboration with <name rend="abbr">figit</name> and other relevant
                     initiatives, and monitoring closely the developments in European legislation. </p>
                  <p>It is clearly essential that the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> be seen to be
                     behaving in a responsible way with respect to the rights of <name rend="abbr"
                        >ipr</name> holders. This implies, for example, that service providers
                     should be required to maintain records of all those with <name rend="abbr"
                        >ipr</name> in their holdings, and that appropriate legal instruments be
                     drawn up defining the nature of those rights and the licence under which the
                     holdings are being made available. Definition and provision of such legal
                     instruments should be charged to a small task group of appropriate experts.

                  <p>It is anticipated that the level of advisory support available for different
                     data sets may vary considerably. At one extreme, it may be impossible to do
                     more than supply documented data resources on a <q>caveat emptor</q> basis;

                     supplying the data resources themselves. Most will fall between these two
                     extremes. In line with other <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> policies, Service
                     Providers will be required to define the level of service which they can

                        >srg</name> where possible. </p>
                  <p>From the end-user's point of view, what is important is a clear statement of

                     In attempting to provide such information, the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>

                  <p>Electronic data sets are not necessarily static objects. A few data sets are
                     highly dynamic, changing from day to day, but even those which are supposedly
                     authoritative may need maintenance or error correction. In the software
                     context, users are accustomed to the notion of regular updates -- whereby
                     manufacturers bring out new versions in which existing errors are removed (and
                     replaced by new ones). Similar considerations apply to data sets. </p>
                  <p>It is the users of data sets who are most likely to identify discrepancies or
                     inconsistencies and they should be encouraged to report these for the benefit

                     responsibility it should be to act on such error reports, but we recommend that
                     redistribution of such information should be a pre-requisite for <name

               <p>All <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> service providers will need to arrange for the
                  long term preservation and storage of their resources, either locally, or by
                  delegating this function to some other service provider, within the <name
                     rend="abbr">ahds</name> or elsewhere. In either case, it is clearly essential
                  that this archival function itself be responsibly and adequately carried out. The
                  objective is to ensure that resources can be recovered, without loss of
                  functionality, and made available on computing or other information processing
                  equipment at any time in the foreseeable future. </p>
               <p>In general the term <term>archive</term> implies <q>for ever</q>; all archivists
                  know, however, that policies allowing for some culling (or removal) of unused or
                  duplicated resources at some time are necessary. There is no reason to believe
                  that electronic archives will be any different from others in this respect, except
                  perhaps quantitatively. To some extent, the existence of properly defined and
                  agreed quality assurance procedures for the accession of <name rend="abbr"
                     >ahds</name> resources may reduce the urgency of the need to define such
                  policies, but their definition, and a clear statement of the criteria underlying
                  them, will still be necessary at some point. In this respect, the <name
                     rend="abbr">ahds</name> will naturally look to the wider library and academic
                  communities for guidance. </p>
               <p>Unlike the archiving of documents or other artefacts, the archiving of
                  electronically held information resources requires a separation between the medium
                  and its content which may not always be easy to carry out. Hardware changes
                  probably make impossible the indefinite preservation of software. However, there
                  is ample evidence that data sets can be preserved for almost indefinite lengths of
                  time simply by establishing routines for the migration of the data from one
                  carrier medium to another, without loss of information. </p>
               <p>Because this task of archival storage is likely to be delegated in many cases to
                  specialist agencies, it is correspondingly important for the <name rend="abbr"
                     >ahds</name> to specify minimal operational requirements for such agencies. The
                  nature of these specifications will also need constant review as technology
                  changes a standard based on the use of magnetic tape might no longer be
                  appropriate in five years time. </p>
               <p>Some aspects are unlikely to change however: these include considerations such as
                  the number of copies held, their locations, the nature and degree of integrity
                  checking carried out both across the resources synchronically and periodically, to
                  check for degradation. </p>
               <p>In general, economies of scale argue strongly for provision of archival facilities
                  as a strategic <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> service, which may be contracted out
                  to specialist agencies offering a guaranteed level of service. Individual <name
                     rend="abbr">ahds</name> service providers may also be able to offer equivalent
                  facilities to others less well endowed. The cost-sharing implications of this are
                  considerable. </p>

         <div xml:id="is">
            <head>Implementation Strategy </head>
            <p>This section provides a strategic overview of the way forward, on the assumption that
               the case for something like the model outlined in section <ref target="st">3 Scope
                  and Structure of the ahds</ref> has been accepted. </p>
            <p>It assumes that an Executive has been appointed, and a small nucleus of Service
               Providers has been selected, whether by open tender, by nomination, or by some other
               means. </p>
            <p>The first step for this nucleus will be to review the constitutional and procedural
               issues discussed in section <ref target="stcon">3.4 ahds Constitution and Procedures
               </ref> and to agree on any necessary revisions or modifications to them with the
               Executive. </p>
            <p>The next step will be to set in motion the process of defining the standards and
               procedures which will constitute a functioning Service. Since the success of the
                  <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> will be largely contingent on close attention to
               appropriate international and <foreign>de facto</foreign> standards, we discuss this
               process in some detail in section <ref target="sd">4 Standardization </ref> above.
               Since the service levels and performance indicators included in the Service provision
               contracts will be related to the standards and procedures defined in this stage, it
               is anticipated that the initial contracts may be provisional, and that the final
               contracts with the initial set of Service Providers will follow this stage. </p>
            <p>In addition to defining standards for data format, data description, data
               preservation and data provision, the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> Executive has to
               set in motion the creation of a unified Catalogue. One simple way of beginning this
               process might be to create a <name>World Wide Web</name> server linking information
               provided by each of the pilot service providers. However, in the long run the <name
                  rend="abbr">ahds</name> catalogue can only be provided using the expertise of the
               library community. Existing services, such as <name rend="abbr">niss</name> and <name
                  rend="abbr">bubl</name>, and pilot projects such as <name rend="abbr"
                  >catriona</name>, and other relevant initiatives will be consulted for assistance
               in defining a development path for this purpose. </p>
            <div xml:id="isp">
               <head>Pilot Data Service Providers </head>
               <p>As noted in section <ref target="stsc">3.1 Disciplines and data types</ref>, the
                  Arts and Humanities Data Service will address a very large and eclectic community,
                  with very widely varying interests. It is correspondingly difficult to identify
                  the minimum set of services which the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> should aim to
                  provide, or to define a <q>critical mass</q> of resources and services which the
                  initial implementation might aim to achieve within two years of start-up. </p>
               <p>Identifying a core collection of data sets is a worse problem than the task of
                  selecting a core collection for a new library, since its scope is not one but many
                  institutions with varying policies for teaching and research. The present report
                  therefore makes no attempt to identify core resources by discipline. Instead, we
                  propose that the initial nucleus of service providers should be chosen in such a
                  way as to maximize the spread of data types supported and disciplines covered. </p>
               <p>At least the following subject areas and data types should be supported in the
                  initial nucleus: <list>
                     <item>historical documents and derived data sets; </item>
                     <item>literary and linguistic textual materials</item>
                     <item>art-historical and archaeological images and artefacts;</item>
                     <item>music, film, and other time-based materials. </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In selecting service providers capable of setting up this nucleus, we expect that
                  the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> Management Committee and funding bodies will
                  choose to build on existing centres of expertise. However, such decisions form no
                  part of the remit of the present report. </p>

            <head>Financial and Costing Considerations</head>
            <p>The following costs of the service can be identified: </p>
            <div xml:id="coexec">
               <head>AHDS Executive</head>
               <p>It is envisaged that the staff will comprise a Director, a technical/research
                  officer and an administrative assistant. All of these staff are required on a
                  full-time and permanent basis. It is vital that the Director be someone of
                  standing in the Arts and Humanities community and it is recommended therefore that
                  the post is at professorial level. The costs of these three posts at current
                  prices including national insurance and superannuation but excluding overheads
                  will be in the order of 90 - 95k annually (about 45k, 27k and 20k respectively).
                  In addition to this approximately 50k will be required annually for equipment,
                  publications, travel and subsistence. </p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="cocons">
               <head>Consultancies</head>
               <p>It is anticipated that during the first two years there will be the need for an
                  additional budget to enable contracts to be provided to specialists to assist in
                  the development of the methodology and procedures to be used by the data service.
                  For example studies might be conducted on the implications of Intellectual
                  Property Rights, or on charging systems. A budget of 50k a year for two years will
                  be required to meet these start-up costs. </p>
            </div>
            <div xml:id="cosps">
               <head>Service Providers</head>
               <p>One of the Service Providers will have responsibility for the development,
                  compilation and maintenance of the catalogue and for the operation of the gateway,
                  whilst the others will have responsibility for the delivery of specified services.
                  Service Providers might be very variable in their scale of operations but for the
                  purpose of costing the service it should be assumed that they will each require
                  two staff and some equipment and travel costs. The costs of this including
                  national insurance and superannuation but excluding overheads will be of the order
                  of 80 - 100k annually per Service Provider. The <name rend="abbr">ahds</name>
                  Executive may bid to be a Service Provider and may be a particularly appropriate
                  candidate to provide the catalogue and gateway, provided it has the relevant
                  expertise. </p>

               <head>Other Issues</head>
               <p>Three issues need special consideration in relation to the funding of the Arts and
                  Humanities Data Service: <list>
                     <item>whether the host institutions will be expected to make a contribution to
                        the costs of hosting the Executive or a Service Provider and whether
                        overheads will be provided. Although there will be benefits to a host
                        institution in running a service it is essential that a national service is
                        provided and that lack of adequate finance does not distort it towards local
                        needs, nor that small institutions with specialist expertise are discouraged
                        from bidding by the need to make a contribution. Local institutional support
                        may be more important for the initial Service Providers than for services
                        added once the initial service is established.</item>
                     <item>whether non-Higher Education institutions will be eligible to receive
                        funding to be a service provider. This is a critical issue since some of the
                        organizations with the most expertise of data on different media are not in
                        the HE sector.</item>
                     <item>the development and implementation of a charging policy must be a high
                        priority, and it must take into consideration the fact that some Service
                        Providers will have greater potential for raising all or part of their costs
                        in the long term than others.</item>

                  course of the Feasibility Study, in some cases in person and in others by

                  information gathering. In a few cases the questionnaire was not considered
                  appropriate, but useful information about the institution or service was sent to
                  the authors. There was also a range of additional material which the authors
                  acquired along the way and found useful. </p>

            <p>This section describes several institutions and projects around the world which
               provide services or which hold digital resources which are relevant to the <name
                  rend="abbr">ahds</name>. In section <ref target="ipuk">8.1 UK Services </ref> we
               list some existing UK-based Institutions which already offer facilities similar to
               those proposed for <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> Service Providers, to a greater or
               lesser extent. In section <ref target="ipnonuk">8.2 Comparable services based outside
                  the UK</ref>, we list some comparable Institutions in Europe and North America.
               Finally, in section <ref target="ipdata">8.3 Example projects </ref>, we list a few
               examples of current Arts and Humanities projects likely to be of interest to the

            <p>It should be emphasized that these lists are all intended for <emph>illustrative

               range from major well-established Services on the one hand to small-scale pilot
               projects on the other. Information here was provided by the Services concerned before
               or during the feasibility study, and has not been checked in detail. </p>

                     <p>This Centre provides data on the atmosphere and its boundaries to
                        researchers working in the area of atmospheric sciences, global climate
                        change and earth observation. Like others which hold data on other physical
                        sciences (e.g. oceanography, solar-terrestrial physics, etc.), the Centre
                        provides access to experimental data sets, many of which can be very large,
                        and very quickly generated (for example, the digital data from satellite
                        observations). Such data sets are thus rather different from those typically
                        used by humanities disciplines, but other aspects of the service provided by
                        such Centres are very similar.</p>

                        data for teaching and research. As well as encouraging current use, there is
                        a strong emphasis on long-term preservation. In January 1993 the Archive set
                        up a <name>History Data Unit</name>, with funding from the <name rend="abbr"
                           >esrc</name> for an initial two years. Some continuation funding will be
                        provided by the <name>British Academy</name> and is being sought from other
                        sources.</p>
                     <p>A particular feature is the <name>BIRON</name> catalogue. This catalogue
                        covers most of the Archive's holdings, and has been built up over a number
                        of years by trained librarians using a controlled vocabulary. The Archive
                        has relationships with several other institutions, such as: <list>

                        rest are opinion polls. The number of data sets is increasing at a rate of
                        about 250 per year.<note>The Archive has an arrangement with the
                              <name>Economic and Social Sciences Research Council</name> whereby all
                           contracts which involving data collection specify that the data must be
                           deposited with the Archive.</note> Each year more than 2,000 data sets
                        are accessed, and over 1,500 data catalogues are distributed. </p>

                        research and teaching data sets for access and analysis by the UK academic
                        community, and the provision of the services required to facilitate and
                        support this. It specializes in the provision of on-line access to large-
                        scale data sets and the software needed to process them for research and
                        teaching purposes. Principal examples of the data are the 1981 and 1991
                        census data, and government survey data sets. Data sets are currently stored
                        in software-specific formats. Software supported include SIR, Ingres,
                        BRS/Search and SASPAC.</p>

                     <p>
                        <q>NetEc</q> is a term that unites a number of projects for networked
                        interaction in academic Economics. At the time of writing, there are three
                        projects, called <title>BibEc</title>, <title>WoPEc</title> and
                           <title>CodEc</title>. They aim to improve the communication of new
                        research results in Economics via electronic media. Traditionally, new
                        research results have been published in paper documents called <q>working
                           papers</q> or <q>discussion papers</q>. The aim of <title>BibEc</title>
                        is to enhance the awareness of these papers in the academic community by
                        establishing means to announce the publication of new papers via electronic
                        media. The aim of <title>WoPEc</title> is to build a collection of
                        electronic working papers in postscript format, for free retrieval by
                        anybody with Internet access. <title>CodEc</title>, which opened in June
                        1994, aims to build a collection of software routines which are useful in
                        the study of Economics. </p>
                     <p>The effort is multinational in scope, with involved people in six countries,
                        but no formal management structure. The project uses an internal
                        bibliographic format referred to as BibEc format. Papers are stored as
                        PostScript files, usually compressed. </p>

                     <p>This library is currently building a data service which will be one of the
                        largest, if not the largest, in Europe. It will consist of a public library,
                        which will succeed the <name>Bibliothque Nationale</name> as France's major
                        repository of printed books. However, it will also include a vast collection
                        of books, images, sound and motion pictures in digital form. The digital
                        resources will include <name>Frantext</name> and several other substantial
                        collections. It is due to open in 1997. </p>

                     <p>The library will provide facilities at its site for members of the public
                        and accredited researchers to refer to digital documents. Large numbers of
                        workstations, some specially developed, will be available for consultation
                        of these resources. The number of workstations envisaged by the year 2000
                        is: <list>
                           <item>254 audio-visual workstations (some of these may be analogue rather
                              than digital);</item>
                           <item>8 CD-ROM playback workstations;</item>
                           <item>12 multimedia workstations;</item>
                           <item>86 academic research workstations.<note>These figures are from

                     </p>
                     <p>The academic research workstations are particularly interesting. Named the
                           <name>Computer-Aided Reading Environment</name> (<name rend="abbr"
                           >care</name>) or in French: <name>Poste de Lecture Assiste par
                           Ordinateur</name> (<name rend="abbr">plao</name>)), these will offer
                        sophisticated facilities for accredited researchers to use text and image
                        documents. The facilities will include features such as navigation,
                        temporary annotation, linking, searching, printing, extracting and temporary
                        saving. </p>
                     <p>The library has negotiated with French publishers agreements to permit
                        electronic storage and use of works still in copyright, thought the initial
                        agreements are for a limited period. Perhaps for this reason, there are no
                        plans to allow remote access to the digital collection; all access will be
                        from the main site in Paris. </p>

                     <p>The digital collection is due to include books, journals, and secondary
                        literature, extending to: <list>
                           <item>100,000 books (average 250 pages each) stored in image form;</item>
                           <item>10,000 books stored in text form, possibly with some form of

                     <p>The intention is to build a strong corpus of French literature and reference
                        texts. The main domains identified for digital holdings are French
                        literature, anthropology, philosophy, history, ethnology, economics, law and
                        the history of science. The corpus is expected to contain both original
                        texts and modern editions which include commentary on the originals. </p>

                        <name rend="abbr">dante</name> was set up in 1993 by several European
                        research networks. Its purpose is to provide advanced international computer
                        network services for the European research community. One of its major
                        activities is the management of <name>EuropaNET</name>. It is today a small
                        organisation employing some ten people (but it is actively recruiting more). </p>
                     <p>In June 1994, <name rend="abbr">dante</name> prepared a proposal to set up
                        an information server called <term>InfoFLOW</term> for the European research
                        community, the main purpose of which would be to assist people to locate
                        valid information sets. It is now recognised that further work is required

                     <head>Overview </head>
                     <p>An <q>Electronic Text Center</q> was founded at the <name>University of
                           Virginia</name> in 1992. It exists to create and support a new broadly
                        based user community within the humanities at the University, and to
                        establish the use of electronic texts as a mainstream resource for pedagogy
                        and research in the University. </p>
                     <p>It has a diverse collection of humanities data sets (see below). Most are in
                        text form, with a few in image form. The texts are encoded with <name
                           rend="abbr">tei</name>-conformant <name rend="abbr">sgml</name>. A key
                        feature of the Center is that the same access software can be used across
                        the collection, even though some of the documents come from CD-ROMs which
                        included proprietary software. </p>
                     <p>Because of contractual obligations with the vendors who supply the texts and
                        the search software, access to the on-line text service is restricted to
                        University of Virginia students and staff.</p>

                     <p>Originally the Center started up with commonly available humanities
                        resources in English and Latin, such as the <title>Oxford English
                           Dictionary</title>, the <title>Patrologia Latina</title> and a collection
                        of texts from the <name>Oxford Text Archive</name>. This corpus has since
                        been added to by data sets generated by the University's staff and students,
                        and it is expected to grow continually in this way. English is the main
                        language, but there are also texts in many other languages including French,
                        German, Latin, Greek and Hebrew. </p>

               <p>In this section we list a number of projects in the Arts and Humanities which are

                  to the <name rend="abbr">ahds</name> community. No attempt has been made here to
                  undertake a systematic overview; instead we have tried only to indicate the range

                        to date. It includes a variety of information on many collections of

                        available from commercial vendors and scholarly sources. </p>

                     <p>The project aims to build a database of copyright holders, initially for

                        and manuscript repositories. The database is intended to be freely
                        accessible via the Internet. Early work suggests that 8,000 authors should
                        be included in the first phase, and that this may be achieved by 1995. </p>
